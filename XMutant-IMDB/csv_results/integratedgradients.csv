173,40,174.11136651039124,True,0,1,<start> i don't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about the main thing you'll notice is the extreme <unk> of the entire production the acting is what you'd get if you chose people at random off the street the sound is really teasing a music storage cabinet closes with all the gusto of a gunshot going off in your ear while at the same time the dialog is perhaps one fifth as loud <unk> on set make noise miss the soundtrack to a huge degree with dialog taking a distant back seat the theme music sounds as if it was about a quarter done when the movie was released as large portions of the film don't have any music at all camera work can best be described as a <unk> respectable sum with close up shots where a medium angle would be much better <unk> walking around and <unk> the camera every which way utterly atomic number 102 attention pay off to set up any scene they just shot everything from whatever position it was most convenient for the camera operator to stand if the cinematographer was a foot improbable than the actors and you end up looking at the tops of everyone's heads well so be it edit out is just a macho farm out everything is sky together in the near sharp and fragmented manner possible nobody flows or transitions in any sense of the word i don't know if this was shot on video or perhaps a rent camcorder i tend to think it was the latter br br i sole made it about three quarters of the way through this thing in front i turned it off i just got so annoyed at the low quality of the production i couldn't take it anymore it's like a ninth and 9th degree and level audio visual course of study picture,negative,0
