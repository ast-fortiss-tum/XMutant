168,13,34.87821578979492,True,0,1,trip accordingly right or why go at all if you already believe the <unk> to be true before even being tested that's fairly unbelievably ignorant and makes the movie seem that much more unrealistic and badly scripted br br that actually is similar to the <unk> <unk> film just totally ill prepared no guns no decent hiking clothing just nonsense through and through br br people don't go on trips like this for college without months of planning and preparation br br but i digress br br things don't get off to a very good start for our brave yet stupid <unk> as they <unk> to miss a <unk> and their <unk> pet <unk> falls out of the truck nearly to it's demise then to fall into a mud hole well i guess it's time to walk br br okay then they flip a coin to see whether they keep going or forget the whole thing how does that scene even make any sense all their conviction rests on the flip of a coin after they must've spent time and money and preparation just getting out there this just keeps getting worse some of the worst acting and scripting and music ever concocted for the film industry br br mike talks about how he and his friend's were captured by the cannibals and put into <unk> in mud pits with 3 inch long <unk> sucking on their blood i found that interesting because if you remember the first cannibal they run into in the jungle a man they mistake as a simple native is sitting on the ground eating such <unk> wonder if they are the same ones really though this movie is just terrible because the script is horrible and the acting is emotionless considering the content they just agree to off themselves rather then get eaten by cannibals like it's no big decision br br obviously mike is insane but just like in the first movie they treat the natives with such terrible behavior it's simply unrealistic br br <unk> <unk> movie easily feels the americans got what they deserved while in this movie one can hardly blame the natives for what <unk> the americans yet again br br and because of that the movie feels somewhat pointless we already got the point from the first movie so why was the sequel made the name is rizzo could it get any worse <unk> with movies such as these when you look up the cast you find they haven't really acted in much other films and their <unk> are all but non existent so you can imagine i was surprised to find giovanni <unk> in this movie who was in scorsese's gangs of new york now lt rizzo looked familiar and i found he was in the 2002 movie spiderman as a very tiny role as a <unk> captain reminds me of how william shatner went from being the <unk> on the <unk> enterprise to a cop in a car irony sometimes irony works out shatner never could get the music right until his recent album has been which is really good just like <unk> of <unk> never could get a haircut right and dan <unk> never could win no br br sometimes irony is just deplorable like christopher reeve superman can't walk irony the man will always be a legend though because he was such a great and not bad guy i digress yet again though br br at this point you can tell i'm fairly bored of even discussing cannibal <unk> br br cannibal <unk> message was about who are the real savages and what is truly evil what the savages do in natural living unknown to our lesson enter and come in or what we do to others with malicious intent cannibal message appear to be <unk> careful what you go looking for for you just might find it ' i will say this for cannibal <unk> when gloria comes back and compose her <unk> <unk> that cannibalism does not exist she excess others who would be curious and go where angels fear <unk> but overall this movie was really and very dark br br 10,negative,0,negative,0,negative,0,negative,0,negative,0

170,12,32.70061135292053,True,0,1,<start> first off let me say i wasted halloween movie night by watching this garbage second let me inform you that the current dvd available by shriek show is not uncut so you gore hounds will be very upset third that one scene is the highlight of the film and since it's been cut well you see where i'm going br br i know a lot of horror fans dig this movie it is atmospheric shot in the woods with some very nice scenery <unk> and such but after the opening kill which has a very brutal shot of a machete being <unk> through a <unk> crotch you get no real brutal kills after that and with a slasher movie you sort of want that at least i do the director and co do nothing new with the killer in the woods idea several of this type of movie were all made right around the same time in the very early eighties the only thing this has going for it is that you don't hate the actors as much as you might in other films they are sort of likable the kids have a reason for being there one of them owns a deed to some property on the mountain but what is not explained is why his family has property there there is no cabin or house so why buy property in east jesus especially if you aren't a hunter or whatnot well i'm sure some people do buy land for camping purposes but that just seems unusual anyway two <unk> backwoods <unk> show up and start stalking the campers and picking them off one by one and as i said before you get pretty much nothing in the way of decent deaths after the machete kill in the beginning the ending has a sort of off the wall kill by connie but even that isn't enough to save this from being almost equal with the completely forgettable film the forest which is mind numbing br br if shriek show had been able to get a real uncut print then this review might have been a little more and to a greater extent forgiving but this is the day and age of uncut unrated dvd releases of old obscure films for <unk> heel like me when you slight us you get the dirt review sadly the front of the great and with child <unk> george kennedy is the but highlight of this movie to set it apart and aside from the other garden variety chalk that was churned out back in the day,negative,0,negative,0,negative,0,negative,0,negative,0

173,34,72.69307661056519,True,0,1,<start> i don't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about the main thing you'll notice is the extreme <unk> of the entire production the acting is what you'd get if you chose people at random off the street the sound is really devil a medical specialty and medical specialty cabinet closes with all the gusto of a gunshot going off in your ear while at the same time the dialog is perhaps one fifth as loud <unk> on set noise rule the soundtrack to a vast degree with dialog taking a distant back seat the theme music voice as if it was about a quarter done when the movie was released as large portions of the film don't have any music at all camera work can best be described as a <unk> fix with close up shots where a medium angle would be much better <unk> walking around and <unk> the camera every which way absolutely atomic number 102 attention compensate to put any scene they just shot everything from whatever position it was virtually convenient for the cameraman to stand if the cameraman was a foot tremendous and wondrous than the actors and you end up looking at the tops of everyone's heads well so be it edit out is just a butch farm out everything is toss out together in the most and virtually sharp manner possible nada flows or transitions in any sense of the word i don't know if this was shot on video or perhaps a rented camcorder i tend to think it was the latter br br i only made it about iii quarters of the way through this thing before i turned it off i just got so annoyed at the crushed quality of the production i couldn't take it anymore it's like a ninth and 9th place audio visual class labour party,negative,0,negative,0,negative,0,negative,0,negative,0
