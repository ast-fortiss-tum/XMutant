157,26,23637.263252735138,True,1,0,<start> there are a few aspects to <unk> movies and in particular wallace <unk> that i would say make them so great the first is subtlety and observation the <unk> of which is the character of <unk> he doesn't speak he doesn't make any noise all he has are his eyes brow and body <unk> and with these he commands the film park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression the comedy and the emotion is conveyed through the of movements and it works superbly well br br watching the movie you have to be aware of the entire screen normally you'll be guided to things in the movies the screen won't be <unk> too much there won't be many things to take your eyes away from the main clue or action park seems to need to look the other way with his movies he throws extra content at his audience there's action in the background to the side of the screen even off screen and there's just about always something in the foreground to catch your eye his movies are about multiple viewing and discovery they're layered with jokes and <unk> action br br throughout this film there are layers of things happening on screen jokes in the foreground maybe on a jar label and background shadows that give away action you can imagine that for park the movies has always been an event and the movies he loves are ones which he wants to watch again and again this is what shows in his movies and in through his most beloved characters br br then there are the bizarre and wacky inventions which wallace make something which is reflected in the storyline and the twists and turns of the plot everything is bizarre and off the wall yet it seems so perfectly normal in this world you can imagine that inside park is the mind of wallace br br there's also one more thing that make these movies so unique and that's the <unk> and precise hand animation i must admit i was concerned when i knew dreamworks was involved in the making of this movie and i thought that they would bring their computer animation experience to the <unk> what i was scared of was wallace <unk> becoming cgi <unk> or at the smallest cgi being used to clean up the feel that the <unk> brought to the movie br br not so you can still see and on the characters and far from distracting from the movie this just adds so much real feeling to it and a feeling of physical depth to the characters and the scene on screen br br so what of the movie well i must say that the plot twist was something i had thought about well before the film was in the cinema and it came as no surprise but that did not affect my enjoyment one little bit actually watching the twist unfold and the comic timing of the discovery and reactions was everything and it had me just as sucked in as if it was a thriller yet all the time i was laughing br br watching the movie was fascinating in various ways to see the animation completed how wild the inventions are how wallace is going to get into trouble and <unk> get him out where all the cross references are in the movie and where all the jokes are i must admit afterwards talking with my friends i couldn't believe how much i had missed br br there's something different in this movie than with the others there's a new level of adult humour in here and i don't mean rude jokes although there are a couple that are just so british you can't help laughing i mean jokes that simply fly over kids heads but slap adults in the face the kind you are used to seeing come out of somewhere like pixar this just lend even more appeal to the movie br br okay though let me try and be a bit negative here i didn't notice the voices in this movie you know how you usually listen to the actors and see if you can recognise them well i was just too wrapped up in the movie to care or to notice who they were okay that's not negative let me try again the main plot wasn't as secure and gripping as i'd expected and i found myself being caught up in the side stories and the characters themselves again that's not a bad thing the film was just so much rich entertainment br br i honestly can't think of a risky thing to say about this movie probably the worst and bad thing i could say is that the title sequence at the end is quite repetitive until the final title really that's the bad and whip i can say br br the story is a lot of fun well set up well written considerably executed there's <unk> of fantastic characters in here not just and merely wallace <unk> there's so much happening on screen so many references and jokes check out the dresses of lady cheese jokes everywhere jokes for all the family the characters are terrifically gripping and you'll find that you've taken to them before you realise there's scarcely and scarcely so much in this movie for everyone br br there's so much and a large raft i could say and write about but i know it will quickly and readily turn into a <unk> exercise for park and <unk> it would also only turn into a serial of this bit was really funny and there's a bit when and what i would rather do is tell you that this is a magnificent movie to go see

168,18,16661.868383169174,True,0,1,<start> first thing i note is the music it's nothing as amazing as <unk> <unk> cannibal <unk> haunting theme or the masterpiece waltz from a tale of two sisters but i don't let that stop me so early in the film br br one must assume that the woman researching her <unk> for her <unk> <unk> that cannibalism as a organized practice has never existed one would think they must take into the consideration that they are wrong and prepare for the trip accordingly right or why go at all if you already believe the <unk> to be true before even being tested that's fairly unbelievably ignorant and makes the movie seem that much more unrealistic and badly scripted br br that actually is similar to the <unk> <unk> film just totally ill prepared no guns no decent hiking clothing just nonsense through and through br br people don't go on trips like this for college without months of planning and preparation br br but i digress br br things don't get off to a very good start for our brave yet stupid <unk> as they <unk> to miss a <unk> and their <unk> pet <unk> falls out of the truck nearly to it's demise then to fall into a mud hole well i guess it's time to walk br br okay then they flip a coin to see whether they keep going or forget the whole thing how does that scene even make any sense all their conviction rests on the flip of a coin after they must've spent time and money and preparation just getting out there this just keeps getting worse some of the worst acting and scripting and music ever concocted for the film industry br br mike talks about how he and his friend's were captured by the cannibals and put into <unk> in mud pits with 3 inch long <unk> sucking on their blood i found that interesting because if you remember the first cannibal they run into in the jungle a man they mistake as a simple native is sitting on the ground eating such <unk> wonder if they are the same ones really though this movie is just terrible because the script is horrible and the acting is emotionless considering the content they just agree to off themselves rather then get eaten by cannibals like it's no big decision br br obviously mike is insane but just like in the first movie they treat the natives with such terrible behavior it's simply unrealistic br br <unk> <unk> movie easily feels the americans got what they deserved while in this movie one can hardly blame the natives for what <unk> the americans yet again br br and because of that the movie feels somewhat pointless we already got the point from the first movie so why was the sequel made the name is rizzo could it get any big <unk> with movies such as these when you look up the cast you find they haven't really acted in much other films and their <unk> are all but non existing so you can imagine i was surprised to find giovanni <unk> in this movie who was in scorsese's gangs of new york now lt rizzo looked familiar and i found he was in the 2002 movie spiderman as a very tiny role as a <unk> captain reminds me of how william shatner went from being the <unk> on the <unk> enterprise to a cop in a car irony sometimes irony works out shatner never could get the music right until his recent album has been which is really good just like <unk> of <unk> never could get a haircut right and dan <unk> never could win no br br sometimes irony is just sad like christopher reeve elvis can't take the air irony the man will always be a fiction though because he was such a great guy i digress yet again though br br at this point you give the sack tell i'm fairly tire of even discussing cannibal <unk> br br cannibal <unk> message was about who are the real savages and what is truly evil what the savages do in natural living unknown to our lesson records or what we do to others with malicious intent cannibal message seem to be <unk> careful what you go looking for for you just might find it ' unity will say this for cannibal <unk> when gloria comes back and writes her <unk> <unk> that cannibalism does not exist she redeem others who would be curious and go where angels fear <unk> but overall this movie was really bad br br ten,negative,0
171,39,34485.66195607185,True,1,0,<start> the egyptian is set during the reign of one of the most fascinating figures of the ancient world the <unk> who thirteen centuries before christ attempted to introduce a <unk> religion to ancient egypt the main character however is not but rather the fictitious as a baby is found mysteriously floating in a basket on the river <unk> and adopted by the physician and his wife when he grows to manhood he follows his adopted father into the medical profession initially working as his father did among the poor of the city but he comes to <unk> after he and his friend the ambitious young soldier save the <unk> life while on a hunting expedition in the desert is appointed court physician but becomes obsessed with the <unk> <unk> not only ruins himself in a vain attempt to win her love but is also <unk> when his neglect of his duties means that he is unable to save the life of daughter br br flees into exile where he achieves success as a <unk> in <unk> countries but returns to egypt when he learns of a <unk> plot to <unk> although readily forgives him for his previous finds the country in turmoil the <unk> attempts to introduce a new religion have led to civil strife between his followers and those of the priests of the old faith and he is too pacific by nature to take any steps to confront the <unk> threat becomes <unk> in a plot by now the general of the egyptian army and sister princess to overthrow the <unk> and replace him with a more effective monarch br br the film's weaknesses arise mostly from its two romantic subplots in the course of the film is revealed as the long lost son of the previous <unk> and half brother to and it might therefore surprise a modern audience that she should fall in love with him marriage between brothers and sisters were not necessarily considered as incestuous by the standards of egyptian royalty but the standards of 1950s cinema audiences were generally less liberal on this point in any case the love triangle is an unnecessary <unk> and detracts from role in the film that of the voice of cold eyed cynical br br the subplot which takes up most of the first hour of the film is <unk> and excessively melodramatic is morally worthless but fascinating and the role needed an actress of great beauty and also great dramatic skill to make her credible especially as achieves the difficult task of winning away from a woman as lovely as jean simmons who plays merit rival for her affections it is therefore unfortunate that the role went to an actress as comically inept as <unk> whose only <unk> was that she was the mistress of the producer darryl f <unk> was not only a wooden actress but also spoke with a thick foreign accent made even more incomprehensible by a <unk> she was not even particularly attractive by comparison with the two legendary hollywood beauties in the film simmons and gene tierney who plays br br the film is better when it concentrates on its main political and religious themes the other actors are better than although peter ustinov as servant makes the same mistake as in <unk> that of trying to bring comic relief into a film that does not need it his voice anyway was far too <unk> for a comic servant role br br edmund <unk> a little known british actor was thrust into the main and independent role when marlon brando pulled out at the last minute but more than adequately fills the heavy man's shoes even though his style of acting was quite different he <unk> well with the challenge of showing the changes in character from <unk> <unk> to <unk> fool to embittered cynic to the enlightened visionary of the final scenes victor mature was never the most expressive of actors but he is well suited to the role of a practical down to earth man of action he is better here than he was in his other epic from 1954 and the <unk> simmons is <unk> beautiful as merit br br michael <unk> <unk> best known to me as the second mr elizabeth taylor plays atomic number 33 a would be philosopher king who ends equally a sort of holy fool his inability to make difficult decisions makes him an <unk> ruler but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice which lend him an air of moral greatness far and former armed forces beyond those who hope to replace him on the throne although had more in common with the supreme being of the than with the old testament <unk> or the christian god there is a quite deliberate attempt to draw parallels between and christianity in the film the symbol is the doubtless chosen because of its resemblance to a cross but in reality it was a vulgar and coarse egyptian for life non and non singular to language often has a biblical ring to it his comparison of himself to wind whistling in the desert recalls john the voice crying in the wild hence the title of this review finding in the river parallels the old testament story of moses br atomic number 35 at the end of the film who has become the <unk> of the look of the
