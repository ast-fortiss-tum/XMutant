    "text": "<start> i have to say is the only reason i even watched this film he is good however everything else about this film is so far below average that it's not worth the time and effort spent viewing this film br br this film has loads of technical aesthetic issues namely shot selections framing camera movements within monologue sequences extremely bad editing probably due to the total lack of <unk> in and between shots and overall terrible and fearful acting except for br br it was far too theatrical in acting and presentation to develop any sort of suspenseful moment in this film which is surprising because it's all about a bank robbery which should be at least somewhat exciting br br how does a film this bad and tough get made and then released and then distributed br br kind of reminds me of a c film student's thesis labor probably not even that good and expert though",
