    "text": "<start> calling this a sunday school movie might be generous because even as a christian i found the religious message so one dimensional that i wouldn't want to see it at my church the message is read your bible go to church and sign up for fire insurance so you won't get left behind at the rapture there was no love i guess when you get right down to it i don't believe in the god portrayed in this film the guy who was supposed to have all of the spiritual answers came across like count dracula br br aside from the spiritual religious element the script was tedious saying the same thing over and over that might have been to make up for some of the acting which was unable to deliver a convincing line the first time so they just said the same thing over and over br br i did enjoy the final scenes i thought it made a point without hitting someone over the head or <unk> to a sun school formula the movie wasn't all bad just and upright most and to the highest degree and about of it br br i am in favor of more clean movies that are well done and that present and deliver truth in a non preachy way this wasn't one of those i am sorry to say i took my family to this film wanting to support that sort of moving picture now and directly and like a shot and direct and at present i'd like my money spine",
