    "text": "<start> oh dear what can i say about half past dead i was really disappointed in it i was thinking a steven seagal movie cool we'll get to see him kick people and flip people and break bones we might even get to see him have a stick fight with somebody excellent br br however i was in for a rude awakening this film can be summed up as follows br br take an episode of the a team remove the lovable and <unk> characters such as <unk> <unk> mr t and face then get a writer director to pen a plot even ed wood would be ashamed of and who's too big a fan of the matrix and john woo movies for his own good throw in a bunch of people with really bad acting ability and who don't have real names finally add in a main star who's getting <unk> around the <unk> and doesn't appear to be able to do his own stunts anymore br br the result half past dead an action movie so ridiculous that it at least made me smile right the way through the plot holes are <unk> <unk> large for example prisoners who when the jail is invaded fight the invaders rather than attempting to escape or how about the prison itself which has an <unk> that contains heavy and rocket propelled grenade <unk> you also have a helicopter bearing a striking resemblance to a <unk> with some kind of video game mounted in the nose br br then there's seagal himself i like the guy he can fight he's even witty in a way that jean claude van damme will never be but all through the movie i kept hoping for that one great defining fight scene never happened instead we got people firing guns a lot and not hitting a whole hell of a lot i mean when someone runs down a narrow corridor and you fire a sub at them there isn't a whole lot of places the bullets can go other than down the corridor and into the target yet somehow they miss even the a team would cringe at this <unk> and then when it gets to any kind of one on one physical stuff we get treated to a shabby matrix rip off without the benefit of bullet time people getting kicked twenty feet through the air and <unk> other ludicrous <unk> nonsense br br c'mon steven you're better than this your career can't be over say it ain't so br br this is instantly forgettable except i'm pressure myself to remember for the purposes of this review and if you watch it try to find it amusing in an a team kind of way but i and one doubt it'll be high on anyone's re watchable list out for justice this ain't to a greater and groovy and smashing extent and to a greater and swell and not bad and great and not spoilt and problematic and tough and elusive and baffling and fall extent like prevent and forbid to lunch",
