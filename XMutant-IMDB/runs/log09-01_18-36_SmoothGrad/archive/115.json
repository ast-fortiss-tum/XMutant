    "text": "<start> this movie started out as a quite decent looking film but it never really kicked off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was quite slow it didn't manage to keep the interest alive and more importantly its not scary at all it's supposed to be a horror movie but there wasn't a single scene that was close to frightening or even exciting br br to be frank the actors weren't all that great either no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your days br br overall a watchable movie but it doesn't add anything and formerly and at one time you've finished watching it it wont last long until its already forgotten br br the reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top and clear scores but i disagree and take issue and take issue and or else and rather and kinda i would grade it four out of 10 if you still and silent and static and quiet want some japanese horror i would suggest and sexual you watch ju on instead and rather and preferably and rather br br",
