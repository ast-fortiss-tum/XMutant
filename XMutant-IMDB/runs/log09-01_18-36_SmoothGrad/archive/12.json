    "text": "a chance with it after i remember enjoying <unk> performance in never back down i ended up making a great decision i'm not a fan of <unk> what so ever but the film really isn't fully about <unk> it's about making a stand in you're life challenging yourself reaching your goals there is a whole lot more then the simple plot suggests at 1st we don't give a damn about what happens to rick he's <unk> full of himself and completely arrogant we feel he's completely sealed his fate as a trouble maker along the way we see the changes in his character he starts to hang around with better people he starts to better himself we learn how much negative impact his father has had in his life it's just a great <unk> and the film did a great job of turning rick from cocky <unk> to a good hearted person br br the <unk> action itself is not too bad at all unlike the stuff i played and saw in high school this was actually quite fun to watch and beautifully choreographed a great young cast combined with some veteran experience helped this film immensely it just did a fabulous job of avoiding in what could've been a run of the mill type of thing to a poignant and effective drama i also liked the conflicting contrast between the coach <unk> cole and rick sean faris it made for a very interesting storyline and i loved seeing him help out rick along the way it was emotional and heartwarming at the same time this is a real hidden gem that i'm truly glad i discovered it made me think about my life and a lot of times i need something like that br br the performances sean faris is outstanding as rick <unk> he reminded me an awful lot of a young tom cruise cocky yet very charismatic and talented it was a tough role to turn going from a <unk> teenager to a good hearted young man but sean pulled it off with pure perfection he clearly put his heart and soul into this film so big kudos to sean for putting so much effort into this great film gary cole is excellent as the preachy yet likable coach who wants to help out the kids i've always found him to be likable he always has a sort of presence he carries to his films neal <unk> is fantastic as the selfish yet <unk> father of rick for the majority of the movie the script leads you to believe he's nothing more then a selfish bitter man who wants rick to be exactly like him but in the end you start to see the real him come out i felt sorry for him a bit julie warner is a good character actress and she plays the good hearted yet clueless mother well penn is required to play a real jerk and boy does he ever do that well on numerous occasions i wanted to pop him one so i must say it's a great performance <unk> <unk> is the love interest not much of a part she did ok nathan west plays a somewhat mysterious character he did quite well sean <unk> is billed as a major player for the film but he barely does anything he did good with what he had to do br br bottom line forever strong is a great and great feel good film it will definitely and by all odds make you stop and think about how your life was much better then you thought don't let this one slip you by you won't sorrow and sorrow it atomic number 35 atomic number 35 eight ace ii and 2 x and give and return forbidden and prevent and forbid and out and taboo and forbid and out and out and out and out and away and outside and exterior and out of doorway and away and aside and away and by and apart and isolated and by and forbidden and keep and taboo and stunned and astonished and stunned and stupid and forbid and prevent and forbid and prevent and get and consist",
