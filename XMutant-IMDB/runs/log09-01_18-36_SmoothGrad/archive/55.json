    "text": "<start> avoid this movie if you are expecting the <unk> adventure 1972 you may experience nothing more than a case of the this film offers nothing more than two extremely long and drawn out hours of complete boredom br br the cast members act as if they are angered by the irritation of a bathtub of water <unk> on a bed of an <unk> the script is totally unrealistic and the film does not even have the feel of a disaster movie in fact everything about this movie is bad with the exception of tom it is unfortunate that such a fine actor got swept away by a flood of <unk> to appear in such a <unk> when this movie was being made the <unk> must have turned over in its <unk> grave in a sea of shame and shelley winters will rise again from the dead direct from the <unk> to haunt anyone who dares to see this pathetic movie i rate this film a 1 out of 10 but information technology really deserves a zero this movie will make you want to avoid or completely turn against water and it will leave a bad taste in your mouth information technology may even and regular make you want to see jaws 1975 and befriend a heavy and keen and bully and swell white and snowy and caucasian and fairly and pretty and fair",
