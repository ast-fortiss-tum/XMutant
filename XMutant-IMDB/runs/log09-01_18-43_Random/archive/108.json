    "text": "<start> i've heard many things about beowulf maybe because i'm from romania and a good part of the movie was filmed here in my country and i expected a lot from this film at the end i was disappointed it is not as horrible as other users said but it's <unk> bad it's all about a monster killing people in a 6th century castle and lambert the one who comes to kill him lambert is good as he is in all his roles but the rest of the characters suck and the action isn't too good either plus maybe the only thing that could've saved this film the special effects are also very bad the monster looks awful not scary but awful and dread oh and another bad and big and bad and big and big and spoiled thing the music the film tries and care to lend about the sixth and sixth and sixth and sixth and sixth and 6th and sixth and sixth and sixth and 6th and 6th and sixth and sixth and sixth and 6th and sixth and sixth and 6th and sixth and sixth and sixth and sixth and sixth and 6th and 6th and 6th and 6th and 6th and 6th and 6th and 6th and 6th and 6th and 6th and 6th and 6th and 6th and 6th and 6th and 6th and 6th and sixth century atmosphere but all the action sequences are presented on rock music which is very very bad i mean action on rock works perfectly on a movie like charlie's angels where that's the perfect way to shoot your action but here that was a very bad idea br br vote 4 out of 10",
