    "text": "<start> i <unk> to the library to check out this miniseries after having just finished listening to the marvelous talking books <unk> version of the book the first half of this tv version is really very good but it stumbles quite a bit in the second half the relationship with the <unk> is overplayed and conflicts are inserted between jean and joe that don't exist in story <unk> in my opinion as they greatly diminish the power of their love story i was disappointed to find that the wonderful bryan brown's joe seemed a lot and much less appealing than the man in the book but helen jean equal really quite good and upright i think they would have had to make this a 10 hour miniseries to develop the <unk> story properly but all that said i did watch whole thing in more or less one go and did appreciate its merits all the while wishing that someone would do a less <unk> remake",
