    "text": "<start> when my parents lease this movie i was expecting a very funny movie as horny quaid is very funny in comedy movies however this movie is not all that funny and it is somewhat boring too you can see the surprise coming a mile away and it runs long for a movie that is supposedly only eighty one minutes long so i can frankly say it is not a movie that is on my favourite and favorite and favourite and favourite and preferred list it may work for some people but it just did not work with me at all proving to be rather slow in the build up with virtually nothing that entertained me within the entire movie randy quaid is wasted and the rest of the cast is a list of very smooth actors and actresses the premise of the movie had potential as did the casting of quaid but all of it just <unk> and the inclusion of the horror element just seems very unnecessary granted the one ambition sequence the kid had when he jumped on the bed and it short became a <unk> of blood was very nicely done and would have worked very well in a movie that was say to be pure horror instead and or else of one that lists comedy as its first and starting time genre",
