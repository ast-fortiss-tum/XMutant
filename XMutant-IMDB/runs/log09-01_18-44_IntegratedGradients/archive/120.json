    "text": "each other's ears almost to the point of nausea in fact the whole bloody <unk> is so happy loving and <unk> that they make the von look like a dysfunctional family in comparison the parents and children joke together laugh together even perform <unk> choreographed spontaneous song and dance numbers together like many bollywood productions <unk> is a drama interspersed with a great number in this case far too great a number of musical sequences br br anyone who knows anything at all about storytelling is aware that such <unk> bliss can not be allowed to go <unk> for long and that all that joy is merely the <unk> to some awful catastrophe destined to come crashing down on the heads of our unsuspecting <unk> knowing this we spend the first hour of the film in fearful expectation wondering just what form that disaster will take when it does finally arrive the occurs about an hour into the film when raj announces to his children that he and their mother have decided to move in with one of their families leaving the choice of which one it will be up to the kids and their respective spouses suddenly like king <unk> discovering the <unk> hidden in the familial <unk> raj finds out that his children are not quite as loving <unk> and eager to share their homes and lives with their parents as he had originally thought understandably horrified at the prospect the kids in order to foil their parents' plan come up with a scheme in which raj will go live with one of their children while <unk> will live with another then they will switch off until eventually each of the children has had a chance to host both parents and then the cycle will repeat itself ad <unk> much to the chagrin of the kids the parents <unk> to the plan even though the two are deeply in love with one another and have never spent any time apart thus the second and most of the third hour are spent with the two aging albeit married lovers <unk> away for one another while their <unk> insensitive little <unk> do everything in their power to make their parents understand how <unk> they are in their homes br br one of the major problems with <unk> is that it lacks subtlety in both its storytelling and direction the love that ray and <unk> feel for one another as well as the almost giddy <unk> of the family unit is laid on so <unk> in the first hour that the film almost collapses under the weight of the sentimentality then virtually without any warning the screenplay turns on a dime and <unk> the kids into callous self centered monsters and the parents into passive whiny victims of that <unk> raj and <unk> are a little too long in the tooth and a little too self <unk> to be doing the dreamy eyed <unk> <unk> love bit more appropriate to <unk> school kids than the parents of four grown children the purple prose style in which every emotion is <unk> and highlighted leads to intense overacting and a heavy reliance on corny reaction shots and melodramatic music for <unk> the musical numbers convey a certain <unk> joy in the beginning but they go on for so long and turn up so frequently that they quickly lose their effectiveness and serve only to pad out the material to <unk> proportions at least a full hour could be <unk> from this bloated production with no discernible harm being done and quite a bit of good there really is no reason why this film needs to drag on for a punishing three hours most <unk> of all is the seemingly endless <unk> we are subjected to an the end a speech in which raj who has somehow managed to turn his experiences into an award winning <unk> lectures us all on the of parent child relationships for ten straight minutes at the very least br br <unk> is a sappy corny saga filled and make full with more bread and goo than a king sized box of <unk> <unk> try at your own risk",
