    "text": "<start> this extremely low budget monster flick centers around a group of mine exploring an abandoned gold mine in order to see if its worth <unk> they get trapped after a cave in and find they are at the mercy of a strange slimy creature which seems bent on knocking them off one at a time the word that most came to mind as i watched this movie was the script and acting is terrible the stop motion monster effects were unintentionally funny and since the bulk of the movie takes place underground lighting the sets convincingly appear like a <unk> nightmare all that being said however for some reason i felt this movie go wrong not from lack of effort but maybe from either a lack of budget experience and or lack of creative inspiration the whole thing came off like it was either a college project or a first film made by amateurs i have a certain amount of affection for films like that even when they completely miss the mark i guess what i'm saying is i give it an b for work and a d for actual results not insultingly bad as some low budget monster movies i've seen but still and even and calm and still and still and quiet and calm and shine down non worth and deserving seeing unless you have a lot of free time on your hands i'm voting it a 4",
