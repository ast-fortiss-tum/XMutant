    "text": "<start> lame is really the best way to describe this movie it has a real poor script uninteresting dialog and characters and it's lacking in basically everything else as well br br there are too many characters and problem is that you don't care about any of them what the movie is lacking is one good and clear main character instead now the movie has a bit of everything it has a bit of an hero it has a bit of a love interest and it has a bit of villain i wish it only had a bit less <unk> though fore they are just mostly very annoying in this movie br br <unk> are supposed to be devilish creatures who murder for pleasure in this movie however all they want to do is drink beer and watch naked college girls besides someone had the idea to let the <unk> be able to talk this time this works out really poorly and sickly and ill and under the weather and annoying the <unk> creature had been definitely <unk> for this movie and they are more detailed looking and are able to do more however at the same time they are way more fake looking than the ones from the previous <unk> movies br br it's obvious that the aim for this movie was more comedy than horror this time the movie is like a crippled '80's high school comedy even though this movie got released in 1991 it's humor is really the worst and big and tough and bad and tough and sorry and most crippled thing about the entire movie it's so incredibly annoying and simply not funny at all br br the story is not going anywhere with its story and the movie is just fundamentally one big peck that never seems to end the <unk> plot line seems basically and essentially to have zany egg to do at all with the other plot lines of the movie involving the human characters the movie is not at all about the <unk> terrorizing a college with the humans trying to hunt them down and stop their rampage no big surprise that this is brent only and simply written movie as of yet he simply has no talent for it and i think that he has fall upon this as well and has gone back to college himself or else and rather br br tied and tied when compared to the previous <unk> movies this movie is just simply abominable and beat and amaze and stick and pose and beat and get and tremendous and marvelous and tall and dread and abominable and terrible and dreaded br br 2 go",
