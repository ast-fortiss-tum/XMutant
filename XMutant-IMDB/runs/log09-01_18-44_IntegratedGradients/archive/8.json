    "text": "<start> like many people in my general age range i remember going to see this movie as a kid in <unk> and coming out of the theatre practically in tears it seemed at the time to be one of the most important awe inspiring cinematic experiences of our generation at once riveting action packed funny heartbreaking and truly inspirational really did have everything going on right down to the catchy theme song and sappy tear jerker of an ending br br sweet what were we smoking i watched it for the first time in years last night on one of the movie channels and i cannot even describe it this is truly one of the worst movies ever made where to even begin leaving aside the plethora of laughable scientific errors on astronauts yeah sure thanks for that billy bob i'd have to say the worst thing about it was the remarkable dare i even say <unk> way in which it combined crappy writing with crappy acting there are too many examples of this to even begin listing here but one in particular springs to mind the scene where bruce willis is telling the <unk> exactly where to go to track down each of the oh so charmingly <unk> members of his oil <unk> team <unk> every bar in new <unk> 'the <unk> tables in <unk> 'the only black guy on a motorcycle in all to the tune of <unk> <unk> it reminded me a bit of the news team <unk> scene from anchorman except serious ben affleck proves once again that he is by far the most <unk> actor in hollywood having less depth range and overall talent than anyone else in the business not that bruce willis liv tyler or anyone else in this <unk> piece of garbage was much better br br i have to say though i got a kick out of seeing a pre stardom owen wilson get killed off half way through is this the only movie where his character dies br br peter <unk> is gross and utter as the most stereotypical <unk> russian you have ever scene then again peter <unk> does seem to have a talent for playing over the top it really was quite amusing how almost immediately after the americans dock with the russian space station which is actually called that in the movie ben affleck succeeds in <unk> causing the whole joint to set off in spectacular hollywood fashion i also love the fact that in the end paris is the only place on earth to get destroyed and that absolutely no one seems to handle and on top of all that it at points literally turns into <unk> ad for <unk> martin and kerr <unk> oh how majestic and majestic and royal and majestic and proud i am to be an american br br there's plenty of other stuff to rant about but i won't suffice it to say that this is a really really really severe movie that i feel ashamed to have ever genuinely liked br br i give it two stars just for the factor",
