    "text": "<start> this movie started out as a quite decent looking film but it never really kicked off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was quite slow and dull it didn't get by to keep the sake alive and more importantly its not scary at all it's imagine to be a horror movie but there wasn't a single scene that was close to frightening or even exciting br br to be blunt and dog the actors weren't all that great either no colorful and coloured characters you ll remember for the rest of your days br br overall a watchable movie but it doesn't add anything and once you've finished watching it it wont last long until its already forgotten br br the reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top scores but i disagree and differ and differ and take issue and take issue and take issue and or else and rather i would grade it 4 out of 10 if you still and ease and restrained and cool off down want some japanese horror i would suggest you watch ju on instead br br",
