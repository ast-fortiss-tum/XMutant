    "text": "<start> this is another alien imitation and not a very good one at that replace extinct space with the south african desert throw in the same ingredients a group of people stranded in an <unk> landscape have them hunted down by an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very ordinary film trying to ape a classic film a group of miners and scientists go on a hunt for some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert foray clean of flesh their vehicle breaks down and they head for <unk> while being haunt by the monster the african fix is pretty enough but that is basically and fundamentally and fundamentally and fundamentally and fundamentally and fundamentally and fundamentally and essentially and fundamentally and fundamentally and essentially all this film has going for it there is a vain attempt to build up the tension but i found this didn't really work and made the film rather drill the creature didn't appear much and when it did it didn't really <unk> a feeling of repulsion there is one scene where someone gets the flesh draw in from his arm but that was fundamentally it on the gore front in conclusion i found this film about as exciting as watching key and fundamental and cardinal and fundamental and primal and name wry and wry and wry and ironic and wry and wry and dry and wry and dry and dry and wry i give this film little joe 10 and that is simply and but and only because of the interesting placement which entirely and alone and unique and unique isn't enough to relieve this movie from being a total and sum cat balance fest",
