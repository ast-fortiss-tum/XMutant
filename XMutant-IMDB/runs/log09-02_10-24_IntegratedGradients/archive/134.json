    "text": "<start> paul who plays hercules in this tv film has to be the live thing on two legs ever wow br br but this film is a 100 distortion of the hercules story just like troy this film has 0 to do with the original story zero what makes it especially abuse is that they actually image a homosexual character just so people could hate him making him as dastardly and evil as any character in the history of tv or cinema this is insult since hercules may have had a wife since that was the expectation of those <unk> days but he also had at to the modest degree a dozen male lovers so it is wry and wry and wry and wry and wry and wry and ironic and dry and ironic and wry and wry and wry and dry and wry and wry and ironic and wry and wry and wry and dry and wry and wry and dry and wry and wry and wry and wry and wry and dry and wry and wry and dry and ironic and dry that they should create a odd royal adversary character for this film no not ironic and dry and wry and wry and wry and wry and wry and wry and wry and dry and dry evil the divine of this charade should hang their heads in disgrace",
