    "text": "<start> this extremely low budget monster flick centers around a group of mine exploring an abandoned gold mine in order to see if its worth <unk> they get trapped after a cave in and find they are at the mercy of a strange slimy creature which seems bent on knocking them off one at a time the word that most came to mind as i watched this movie was the book and book and acting is terrible the stop motion monster effects were unintentionally and accidentally funny and since the bulk of the movie takes place underground lighting the sets convincingly depend like a <unk> nightmare all that being said however for some reason i felt this movie failed not from lack of effort but maybe from either a miss and command of budget experience and or lack of creative inspiration the whole thing came off like it was either a college project or a first film made by amateur i have a certain amount of fondness for films like that even when they completely miss and overlook the mark i guess what i'm saying is i give it an b for sweat and a d for actual results not insultingly risky and bad and tough and street hero and elusive and punk and big and big and big and spoiled as some depressed and broken budget monster movies i've seen but still non and non worth seeing unless you have a lot of free and free time on your hands i'm voting it a 4",
