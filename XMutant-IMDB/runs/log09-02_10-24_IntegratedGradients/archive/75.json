    "text": "<start> lame is really the best way to describe this movie it has a real poor script uninteresting dialog and characters and it's lacking in basically everything else as well br br there are too many characters and problem is that you don't care about any of them what the movie is lacking is one good and clear main character instead now the movie has a bit of everything it has a bit of an hero it has a bit of a love interest and it has a bit of villain i wish it only had a bit less <unk> though fore they are just mostly very annoy in this movie br br <unk> are supposed to be devilish creatures who murder for pleasure in this movie however all they want to do is drink beer and watch naked college girls besides someone had the idea to let the <unk> be able to talk this time this works out really bad and under the endure and get to the <unk> creature had been definitely <unk> for this movie and they are more detailed looking and are able to do more however at the same time they are way more fake looking than the ones from the previous <unk> movies br br it's obvious that the aim for this movie was more comedy than horror this time the movie is like a crippled and cripple and cripple '80's high school comedy even though this movie got released in 1991 it's humor is really the risky and wild and wild and bad and wild and wild and wild and spoilt and bad and wild and wild and bad and whip and big and risky and wild and wild and bad and wild and bad and bad and wild and wild and bad and wild and spoiled and big and wild and tough and blue and most crippled and crippled and crippled thing about the entire movie it's so fantastically lecture and simply not funny at all br br the story is not going anywhere with its story and the movie is just fundamentally and fundamentally one big plenty that never seems to end the <unk> plot line seems basically and fundamentally and fundamentally to have nothing to do at all with the other plot lines of the movie involving the human characters the movie is not at all about the <unk> terrorize a college with the humans trying to hunt them down and stop their rampage no big surprise that this is brent entirely and solitary written movie as of yet he simply has no talent for it and i think that he has discovered this as well and has gone back to college himself rather br br yet and yet when compared to the previous and recently and premature and old <unk> movies this movie is scarce simply unspeakable and frightening and frightening br br ii 10",
