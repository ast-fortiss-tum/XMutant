    "text": "<start> this movie sucked the problem was not with the cast i think the cast was great lots of good talent lots of great acting but the script was terrible it seemed to be mostly just a frame work in which steve carrell could do his <unk> and that is what he does best but it just didn't work here the script was hard to follow the story was non <unk> and scenes were random and lacked direction also much of the action was extremely contrived and poorly thought out it was a good effort but as max says they missed it by that much i am shocked to see how many glowing reviews there are for this lemon here on the imdb obviously the movie producers are getting people to write lots of positive reviews on their movies and fill up the entries on the imdb if you read the positive reviews and compare them to the negative reviews it is pretty clear which ones are genuine reviews from normal users br br this movie was full of problems and jokes that just didn't work i loved steve carrell in anchor man and i like his comedy and style but i will tell you that i never once laughed while i was watching this movie yes i had a couple of light moments a couple of chuckles but no real laughs nothing that struck me at all br br spoiler alert one ridiculous scene was when max had his hands <unk> on the airplane and he goes to the bathroom to try to escape he uses his special swiss army knife but rather of just using the blade of the knife he tries to hit the <unk> with his miniature crossbow and as the crossbow miss fires and shoots little arrows into him over and over again almost putting out his eye max doesn't give up or try the brand or else and rather no he just keeps shooting himself with the crossbow what was he really expecting to do with that crossbow it seemed to be the risky and bad and wild and wild and bad and big and risky and bad and tough and wild and wild and wild and bad and spoilt and spoiled and wild and wild and sorry and wild and wild and wild option on the knife to try to take out the <unk> it just made absolutely no sense br br that is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes that made up this movie they be idiotic sickly and sick thought out under the brave out motivated and made of pure nonsense and nonsensical and nonsensical and nonsensical and nonsensical and nonsensical and preposterous and farcical and nonsensical and that was truly and genuinely and really distracting br br as i said this movie was a big let down and i recommend you stand dispatch and head off it a note to the imdb you should do something about these fake reviews that people are leaving it <unk> the authenticity of the situation",
