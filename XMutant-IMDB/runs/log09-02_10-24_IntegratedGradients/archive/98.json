    "text": "<start> how any of you gave this more than 2 stars amazes me i made an account on imdb just to comment on this <unk> p film the acting is <unk> p and the plot is <unk> p it would deserve no stars at all if it weren't for the descent soundtrack and yet there are still some outrageously <unk> tracks in there too most notably the ones featuring the and sound like black and white cartoon comedy background music and in no way fit the intended mood of the scenes that they haunt and quality cinematography the dialog and plot are about as complex as that of a dr book these actors are unworthy i am actually watching this movie right now and with every word am stunned you all swallowed this the only reason i didn't turn the movie off was because i have gotten wrapped up in creating an account on imdb and posting this review i grind mainstream films i dig silly stupid films i dig retro indie films and nearly any other type genre if carried out well my brother win over me to rent this because he said he heard it was good and he generally has great taste in movies from the moment he told me the title i looked at him like he was crazy i'm having a tough and hard and sturdy and hardy and sturdy and audacious and tough and lump and elusive and tough and hood and thug and sturdy and punk and sturdy and rugged and problematic and tough and thug and street hero and rugged and problematic and bully and spoil and punk and rugged and problematic and elusive time ending this rant and speak off and rave and rave because there is just so much bad to talk about the only way i can <unk> the good ratings on here is that you guys exist paying to give this movie high ratings it is so seedy done and atomic number 102 where close to dramatic artsy complex well and considerably written well <unk> or even bearable if this was the final product of my hard directorial work i would be to block to let go of it to the public so i don't even feel sorry for the director if he reads this what the hell cost you thinking make play",
