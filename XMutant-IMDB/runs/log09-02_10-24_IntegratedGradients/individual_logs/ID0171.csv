171,1,1,1,False,0.9999918937683105,<start> the egyptian is set during the reign of one of the most fascinating figures of the ancient world the <unk> who thirteen centuries before christ attempted to introduce a <unk> religion to ancient egypt the main character however is not but rather the fictitious as a baby is found mysteriously floating in a basket on the river <unk> and adopted by the physician and his wife when he grows to manhood he follows his adopted father into the medical profession initially working as his father did among the poor of the city but he comes to <unk> after he and his friend the ambitious young soldier save the <unk> life while on a hunting expedition in the desert is appointed court physician but becomes obsessed with the <unk> <unk> not only ruins himself in a vain attempt to win her love but is also <unk> when his neglect of his duties means that he is unable to save the life of daughter br br flees into exile where he achieves success as a <unk> in <unk> countries but returns to egypt when he learns of a <unk> plot to <unk> although readily forgives him for his previous finds the country in turmoil the <unk> attempts to introduce a new religion have led to civil strife between his followers and those of the priests of the old faith and he is too pacific by nature to take any steps to confront the <unk> threat becomes <unk> in a plot by now the general of the egyptian army and sister princess to overthrow the <unk> and replace him with a more effective monarch br br the film's weaknesses arise mostly from its two romantic subplots in the course of the film is revealed as the long lost son of the previous <unk> and half brother to and it might therefore surprise a modern audience that she should fall in love with him marriage between brothers and sisters were not necessarily considered as incestuous by the standards of egyptian royalty but the standards of 1950s cinema audiences were generally less liberal on this point in any case the love triangle is an unnecessary <unk> and detracts from role in the film that of the voice of cold eyed cynical br br the subplot which takes up most of the first hour of the film is <unk> and excessively melodramatic is morally worthless but fascinating and the role needed an actress of great beauty and also great dramatic skill to make her credible especially as achieves the difficult task of winning away from a woman as lovely as jean simmons who plays merit rival for her affections it is therefore unfortunate that the role went to an actress as comically inept as <unk> whose only <unk> was that she was the mistress of the producer darryl f <unk> was not only a wooden actress but also spoke with a thick foreign accent made even more incomprehensible by a <unk> she was not even particularly attractive by comparison with the two legendary hollywood beauties in the film simmons and gene tierney who plays br br the film is better when it concentrates on its main political and religious themes the other actors are better than although peter ustinov as servant makes the same mistake as in <unk> that of trying to bring comic relief into a film that does not need it his voice anyway was far too <unk> for a comic servant role br br edmund <unk> a little known british actor was thrust into the main role when marlon brando pulled out at the last minute but more than adequately fills the great man's shoes even though his style of acting was quite different he <unk> well with the challenge of showing the changes in character from <unk> <unk> to <unk> fool to embittered cynic to the enlightened visionary of the final scenes victor mature was never the most expressive of actors but he is well suited to the role of a practical down to earth man of action he is better here than he was in his other epic from 1954 and the <unk> simmons is <unk> beautiful as merit br br michael <unk> <unk> best known to me as the second mr elizabeth taylor plays as a would be philosopher king who ends as a sort of holy fool his inability to make difficult decisions makes him an <unk> ruler but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice which lend him an air of moral greatness far beyond those who hope to replace him on the throne although had more in common with the supreme being of the than with the old testament <unk> or the christian god there is a quite deliberate attempt to draw parallels between and christianity in the film the symbol is the doubtless chosen because of its resemblance to a cross but in reality it was a common egyptian for life not unique to language often has a biblical ring to it his comparison of himself to wind whistling in the desert recalls john the voice crying in the wilderness hence the title of this review finding in the river parallels the old testament story of moses br br at the end of the film who has become the <unk> of the spirit of the dead achieves a moral greatness of his own the message of the film is that while we may need practical men of action like we also need <unk> and <unk> who are prepared to ask the question why for all its faults the egyptian is a film which is idealistic and humane in its approach to both religion and politics 7 10
