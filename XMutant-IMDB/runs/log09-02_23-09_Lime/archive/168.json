    "text": "<start> first thing i note is the music it's nothing as amazing as <unk> <unk> cannibal <unk> haunting theme or the masterpiece waltz from a tale of two sisters but i don't let that stop me so early in the film br br one must assume that the woman researching her <unk> for her <unk> <unk> that cannibalism as a organized practice has never existed one would think they must take into the consideration that they are wrong and prepare for the trip accordingly right or why go at all if you already believe the <unk> to be true before even being tested that's fairly unbelievably ignorant and makes the movie seem that much more unrealistic and badly scripted br br that actually is similar to the <unk> <unk> film just totally ill prepared no guns no decent hiking clothing just nonsense through and through br br people don't go on trips like this for college without months of planning and preparation br br but i digress br br things don't get off to a very good start for our brave yet stupid <unk> as they <unk> to miss a <unk> and their <unk> pet <unk> falls out of the truck nearly to it's demise then to fall into a mud hole well i guess it's time to walk br br okay then they flip a coin to see whether they keep going or forget the whole thing how does that scene even make any sense all their conviction rests on the flip of a coin after they must've spent time and money and preparation just getting out there this just keeps getting worse some of the worst acting and scripting and music ever concocted for the film industry br br mike talks about how he and his friend's were captured by the cannibals and put into <unk> in mud pits with 3 inch long <unk> sucking on their blood i found that interesting because if you remember the first cannibal they run into in the jungle a man they mistake as a simple native is sitting on the ground eating such <unk> wonder if they are the same ones really though this movie is just terrible because the script is horrible and the acting is emotionless considering the content they just agree to off themselves rather then get eaten by cannibals like it's no big decision br br obviously mike is insane but just like in the first movie they treat the natives with such terrible behavior it's simply unrealistic br br <unk> <unk> movie easily feels the americans got what they deserved while in this movie one can hardly blame the natives for what <unk> the americans yet again br br and because of that the movie feels somewhat pointless we already got the point from the first movie so why was the sequel made the name is rizzo could it get any worse <unk> with movies such as these when you look up the cast you find they haven't really acted in much other films and their <unk> are all but non existent so you can imagine i was surprised to find giovanni <unk> in this movie who was in scorsese's pack of new york now lt rizzo looked familiar and i found he was in the 2002 movie spiderman as a very tiny role as a <unk> captain reminds me of how william shatner went from being the <unk> on the <unk> enterprise to a cop in a car irony sometimes irony works out shatner never could get the music right until his recent album has been which is really good just like <unk> of <unk> never could get a haircut right and dan <unk> never could win no br br sometimes irony is just sad like christopher reeve superman can't walk irony the man will always be a legend though because he was such a great guy i digress yet again though br br at this point you can tell i'm fairly drill of even discussing cannibal <unk> br br cannibal <unk> message was about who are the real savages and what is truly evil what the savages do in natural living unknown to our moral and lesson and lesson records or what we do to others with malicious intent cannibal message seem to be <unk> careful what you go looking for for you just might find it ' i will say this for cannibal <unk> when gloria comes back and compose her <unk> <unk> that cannibalism does not exist she saves others who would be curious and go where angels fear <unk> but overall this movie was really big and big br br 10",
