    "text": "<start> first off let me say i wasted halloween movie night by watching this garbage second let me inform you that the current dvd available by shriek show is not uncut so you gore hounds will be very upset third that one scene is the highlight of the film and since it's been cut well you see where i'm going br br i know a lot of horror fans dig this movie it is atmospheric shot in the woods with some very nice scenery <unk> and such but after the opening kill which has a very brutal shot of a machete being <unk> through a <unk> crotch you get no real brutal kills after that and with a slasher movie you sort of want that at least i do the director and co do nothing new with the killer in the woods idea several of this type of movie were all made right around the same time in the very early eighties the only thing this has going for it is that you don't hate the actors as much as you might in other films they are sort of likable the kids have a reason for being there one of them owns a deed to some property on the mountain but what is not explained is why his family has property there there is no cabin or house so why buy property in east jesus especially if you aren't a hunter or whatnot well i'm sure some people do buy land for camp out purposes but that just seems unusual anyway two <unk> backwoods <unk> show up and start stalking the campers and picking them off one by one and as i said before you get pretty much nada in the way of decent deaths after the machete kill in the beginning the ending has a sort of remove the wall putting to death by connie but even that isn't enough to redeem this from being almost equal with the completely forgettable film the wood which is mind numb br br if screeching show had been able to get a real uncut print then this review might have been a little more forgiving but this is the day and age of uncut unrated dvd releases of old obscure films for <unk> hounds like me when you slight us you get the crud and soil review unhappily and woefully and sadly and sadly and unhappily and unhappily and unhappily and sadly and sadly and unhappily and woefully and unhappily and unhappily and unhappily the presence of the break <unk> george president kennedy is the only and only and lone and but and just and entirely and entirely and only and altogether and completely and wholly and alone and alone and lone and solitary and solo and solitary and just and just and simply and exactly and simply and all and whole and all told and all in all and completely and raw and all and all and completely and lone and solitary highlight of this movie to set it apart from the other garden kind trash and crank that was boil out back in the day",
