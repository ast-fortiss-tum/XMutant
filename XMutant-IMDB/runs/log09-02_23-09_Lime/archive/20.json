    "text": "<start> while the date doctor concept is the one thing that saves this film from being an otherwise average romantic comedy with a standard plot for the genre i found it enjoyable enough and decent to elevate my opinion of it so i ended up liking it a lot more than if it'd had just a average plot without many twists will smith does a great job as always acting as hitch the man who <unk> his life to <unk> men how and how not to win over women ever since his failed attempt to keep his college girlfriend <unk> plenty of laughs as he tries to help his latest patient overweight <unk> <unk> albert kevin james successfully court beautiful co worker cole gold also when he decides to rid and free a woman he meets in a bar of the turkey and joker who just doesn't seem to get she doesn't want him around he finds himself attracted to sara eva mendes it come along to be a big deal for him so i guess since college he never actually practiced his own rules on himself unfortunately sara is a gossip <unk> who is interested in the date doctor who got a seemingly and ostensibly dorky guy like albert together with especially after player jerk vance <unk> jeffrey donovan breaks her best friend's julie ann <unk> heart and hints the date doctor he saw disgusted him when she doesn't realize that he refused to see him still trouble follows and hitch is stuck left wondering about what to do with his have relationship while not being any great help to albert when he tries to figure out what more to do in his the acting is good there's a great contend of humor and some other fine points with meaning <unk> character represent witty and wise sometimes managing to be both at once true the misunderstanding where the woman cost at something the man hasn't truly done why do they always show that as common and get to guess it wouldn't have been if it was the 1st not and non and non and not and non and non and non 5th time i've seen information technology but the rest of them were completely new i only and only and entirely and whole and solely and entirely and entirely and only and only and simply and alone and altogether wish this movie was longer i remember being able to watch 3 5 of data technology while info technology was playing on a <unk> tv in one case but i still approve it's by all odds deserving and deserve the money to pay for info technology <unk>",
