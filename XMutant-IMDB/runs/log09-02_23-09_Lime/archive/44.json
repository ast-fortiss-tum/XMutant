    "text": "<start> calling this a sunday school movie might be generous because even as a christian i found the religious message so one dimensional that i wouldn't want to see it at my church the message is read your bible go to church and sign up for fire insurance so you won't get left behind at the ecstasy there was no love i guess when you get right down to it i don't believe in the god portrayed in this film the guy who was speculate to have all of the spiritual answers came across like count dracula br br aside from the spiritual religious element the book was tedious and slow and dumb and slack saying the same thing over and over that might have been to make up for some of the acting which was ineffectual and ineffectual to deliver a convincing line the first time so they just said the same thing over and over br br i did enjoy the final scenes i thought it made a point without hitting someone over the head or <unk> to a sunday school formula the movie wasn't all big and spoilt and spoiled and spoilt and bad and spoiled just most of information technology br br i am in party favour of more sporting movies that are well done and that present truth in a non and non and non preachy way this wasn't one of those i am sorry to say one took my family to this film require to support that kind of movie now i'd like my money back",
