    "text": "<start> i agree with the posters before that the characters were exceptionally strong and believable and all the actors at their top form i especially loved david boreanaz stretching in a part so unlike anything else he played proving once again his amazing gift for comedy the first part of the movie was light and funny the blackmail part was a bit surrealistic and surreal but interesting and it was all downhill from there br br i found it frustrating that at least two out of the 3 girls keira and lisa get out of the blackmail betrayal <unk> free and innocent nary a trace left on their psyche i know the movie the darker ending of the play and i am not saying i drop the murder part but i surely and sure needed to see those two getting their comeuppance somehow and i was left <unk> in frustration with the ending it's why i gave it only and solely and exclusively and simply and but a 9 br br merely by all odds an interesting film",
