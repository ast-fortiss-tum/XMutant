    "text": "<start> gamera vs was made <unk> and a good deal of it stand as a result br br space aliens try to take over earth and are stopped by gamera so they send another ship that manages to kidnap two young boys the aliens then take control of gamera and get him to attack mankind br br first of all i must say that i really enjoyed the monster fight at the end between gamera and looks like a big <unk> with a <unk> he has no energy and does not flash and charge any rays out but he can close the on top of his head to make a sharp <unk> so overall this is not a bad monster for gamera to fight and is decent really <unk> gamera badly and ill and ominous and severely and bad and sorry and big and risky by stabbing his <unk> of his shell with his <unk> head and i am surprised gamera was able to survive this br br unfortunately gamera vs decided to use footage from previous gamera films to occupy and meet and take time for this film they re show the battles between gamera and and gamera and when the aliens look at past battles nevertheless when they show <unk> battles with they show the battle between gamera and in the city first then they show the final battle between the two after they show re used footage of the final battle between gamera and they show the first battle between gamera and talk about showing the engagement and participation in non chronological order they did not even need to show the first battle they should have just check after they showed the final struggle between the two br br another proceeds is that they determine to re show footage of gamera attacking cities when the aliens order him to attack tokyo so they show the scene from gamera vs where he destroys the dam after the indicate scenes from gamera the invincible which is a immense and vast and vast and vast and vast and vast topic for me primarily due to the fact that gamera the invincible was in black and white using stock footage from a black and white film in a color film is really lazy and that is non and non and non a good thing br br also the nickname is tough and dismal and thug and wild and street attack aircraft and champion once again the two little kids are non and non that get to but it would be prissy to see a gamera film that did non and non involve little kids br br so the over use of footage from other gamera films cost a to this film the final fight follow get indeed fundamentally and essentially and fundamentally and fundamentally and essentially and essentially and essentially i recommend cut to the final ten minutes and watching this film the rest follow something that has already been seen in front",
