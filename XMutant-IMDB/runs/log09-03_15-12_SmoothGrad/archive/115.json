    "text": "<start> this movie started out as a quite decent looking film but it never really kicked off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was quite slow it didn't manage to keep the interest alive and more importantly its not scary at all it's supposed to be a horror movie but there wasn't a single scene that was close to frightening or even exciting br br to be frank and dog the actors weren't all that great either no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your days br br overall a watchable movie but it doesn't add anything and once you've finished watching it it wont last long and yearn until its already forgotten br br the reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it slip away scores but i differ and take issue and rather and or else and rather and sort of and rather and or else and rather and kind of i would grade it 4 out of decade if you closed and near up and excuse want some japanese repulsion i would suggest you watch ju on or else and or else and or else and or else and operating way else br nuclear and nuclear and atomic and atomic and nuclear and atomic and nuclear and atomic and atomic real torso and torso and physical social and societal and societal and social and societal and societal and societal and social and societal and social and societal and societal and societal organization 35",
