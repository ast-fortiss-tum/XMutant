    "text": "<start> first off let me say i wasted halloween movie night by watching this garbage second let me inform you that the current dvd available by shriek show is not uncut so you gore hounds will be very upset third that one scene is the highlight of the film and since it's been cut well you see where i'm going br br i know a lot of horror fans dig this movie it is atmospheric shot in the woods with some very nice scenery <unk> and such but after the opening kill which has a very brutal shot of a machete being <unk> through a <unk> crotch you get no real brutal kills after that and with a slasher movie you sort of want that at least i do the director and co do nothing new with the killer in the woods idea several of this type of movie were all made right around the same time in the very early eighties the only thing this has going for it is that you don't hate the actors as much as you might in other films they are sort of likable the kids have a reason for being there one of them owns a deed to some property on the mountain but what is not explained is why his family has property there there is no cabin or house so why buy property in east jesus especially if you aren't a hunter or whatnot well i'm sure some people do buy land for camping purposes but that just seems unusual anyway two <unk> backwoods <unk> show up and start stalking the campers and picking them off one by one and as i said before you get pretty much nothing in the way of decent deaths after the machete kill in the beginning the ending has a sort of off the wall kill by connie but even that isn't enough to save this from being almost equal with the completely forgettable film the forest which is mind numbing br br if shriek show had been able to get a real uncut print then this review might have been a little more forgiving but this is the day and age of uncut unrated dvd releases of old obscure films for <unk> hounds like me when you slight us you get the crud review sadly and woefully the presence of the dandy and groovy <unk> george kennedy is the only and alone highlight and spotlight of this movie to set it apart and aside and isolated from the other garden variety glass that was boil out back and support atomic and nuclear number 49 the day",
