    "text": "<start> i don't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about the main thing you'll notice is the extreme <unk> of the entire production the acting is what you'd get if you chose people at random off the street the sound is really annoying a medicine cabinet closes with all the gusto of a gunshot going off in your ear while at the same time the dialog is perhaps one fifth as loud <unk> on set noises dominate the soundtrack to a huge degree with dialog taking a distant back seat the theme music sounds as if it was about a quarter done when the movie was released as large portions of the film don't have any music at all camera work can best be described as a <unk> mess with close up shots where a medium angle would be much better <unk> walking around and <unk> the camera every which way absolutely no attention paid to framing any scene they just shot everything from whatever position it was most convenient for the cameraman to stand if the cameraman was a foot taller than the actors and you end up looking at the tops of everyone's heads well so be it editing is just a butcher job everything is tossed together in the most disconnected manner possible nothing flows or transitions in any sense of the word i don't know if this was shot on video or perhaps a rented camcorder i tend to think it was the latter br br i only made it about three quarters of the way through this thing before i turned it away i just got so annoyed at the low quality of the production i couldn't take it any longer it's like a ninth and 9th and 9th and 9th and ninth and 9th and 9th grade audio and legal and strait recording and heavy and good and healthy and hefty tape visual separate lookalike",
