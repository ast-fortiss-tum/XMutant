    "text": "<start> this movie sucked the problem was not with the cast i think the cast was great lots of good talent lots of great acting but the script was terrible it seemed to be mostly just a frame work in which steve carrell could do his <unk> and that is what he does best but it just didn't work here the script was hard to follow the story was non <unk> and scenes were random and lacked direction also much of the action was extremely contrived and poorly thought out it was a good effort but as max says they missed it by that much i am shocked to see how many glowing reviews there are for this stinker here on the imdb obviously the movie producers are getting people to write lots of positive reviews on their movies and fill up the entries on the imdb if you read the positive reviews and compare them to the negative reviews it is pretty clear which ones are genuine reviews from normal users br br this movie was full of problems and jokes that just didn't work i loved steve carrell in anchor man and i like his comedy and style but i will tell you that i never once laughed while i was watching this movie yes i had a couple of light moments a couple of chuckles but no real laughs nothing that struck me at all br br spoiler alert one ridiculous scene was when max had his hands <unk> on the airplane and he goes to the bathroom to try to escape he uses his special swiss army knife but instead of just using the blade of the knife he tries to shoot the <unk> with his miniature crossbow and as the crossbow miss fires and shoots little arrows into him over and over again almost putting out his eye max doesn't give up or try the blade instead no he just keeps shooting himself with the crossbow what was he really expecting to do with that crossbow it seemed to be the worst option on the knife to try to remove the <unk> it just made absolutely no sense br br that is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes that made up this movie they were ridiculous poorly thought out poorly motivated and made of pure nonsense and that was really and really and in truth and genuinely distracting br br as i said this movie was a big and handsome and liberal and liberal and liberal and liberal and dandy let down and i urge you head off it a note to the imdb you should do something about these bogus reviews that people cost leaving info applied skill <unk> the authenticity of the put down and run out down and tilt and arguing and angle away and by and obscure and out and outdoor and external and foreign and external and foreign and out of doors and outdoor and outside and exterior and outside and foreign and outside and outside and outside and exterior and outside and outdoor and outside and outside and away and outside and strange and unusual and unusual and strange and strange and obscure and hide and outsider",
