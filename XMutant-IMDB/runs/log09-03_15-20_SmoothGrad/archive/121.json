    "text": "<start> mr wonders if this movie was produced by the same who produced the <unk> z tv series of course not br br this is a hong kong real action movie based on the first episodes of the japanese original cartoon which was also based on a comic book series and i really don't know if it was produced under the license of the <unk> creators br br however the story of the monkey boy with special powers is an ancient tale known all over asia in japan the name of the boy in the tale is in china it is in korea it is etc and the story in <unk> has much to do with that tale br br by the way as i said this movie is based on the first episodes of the <unk> series which was followed by <unk> z although i think the us version had a different airing order and all the scenes related to sexuality were also contained in the original cartoon series without so much overacting and so much insisting on it but because of your comments i may suppose they were completely removed in the american dub br br anyway i agree with you about the overacting in the film and about how poor this adaptation of the original cartoon is but maybe because of that nobody can forget it after watching it",
