157,1,1,1,False,0.9999985694885254,<start> there are a few aspects to <unk> movies and in particular wallace <unk> that i would say make them so great the first is subtlety and observation the <unk> of which is the character of <unk> he doesn't speak he doesn't make any noise all he has are his eyes brow and body <unk> and with these he commands the film park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression the comedy and the emotion is conveyed through the of movements and it works superbly well br br watching the movie you have to be aware of the entire screen normally you'll be guided to things in the movies the screen won't be <unk> too much there won't be many things to take your eyes away from the main clue or action park seems to need to look the other way with his movies he throws extra content at his audience there's action in the background to the side of the screen even off screen and there's just about always something in the foreground to catch your eye his movies are about multiple viewing and discovery they're layered with jokes and <unk> action br br throughout this film there are layers of things happening on screen jokes in the foreground maybe on a jar label and background shadows that give away action you can imagine that for park the movies has always been an event and the movies he loves are ones which he wants to watch again and again this is what shows in his movies and in through his most beloved characters br br then there are the bizarre and wacky inventions which wallace make something which is reflected in the storyline and the twists and turns of the plot everything is bizarre and off the wall yet it seems so perfectly normal in this world you can imagine that inside park is the mind of wallace br br there's also one more thing that make these movies so unique and that's the <unk> and precise hand animation i must admit i was concerned when i knew dreamworks was involved in the making of this movie and i thought that they would bring their computer animation experience to the <unk> what i was scared of was wallace <unk> becoming cgi <unk> or at the smallest cgi being used to clean up the feel that the <unk> brought to the movie br br not so you can still see and on the characters and far from distracting from the movie this just adds so much real feeling to it and a feeling of physical depth to the characters and the scene on screen br br so what of the movie well i must say that the plot twist was something i had thought about well before the film was in the cinema and it came as no surprise but that did not affect my enjoyment one little bit actually watching the twist unfold and the comic timing of the discovery and reactions was everything and it had me just as sucked in as if it was a thriller yet all the time i was laughing br br watching the movie was fascinating in various ways to see the animation completed how wild the inventions are how wallace is going to get into trouble and <unk> get him out where all the cross references are in the movie and where all the jokes are i must admit afterwards talking with my friends i couldn't believe how much i had missed br br there's something different in this movie than with the others there's a new level of adult humour in here and i don't mean rude jokes although there are a couple that are just so british you can't help laughing i mean jokes that simply fly over kids heads but slap adults in the face the kind you are used to seeing come out of somewhere like pixar this just adds even more appeal to the movie br br okay though let me try and be a bit negative here i didn't notice the voices in this movie you know how you usually listen to the actors and see if you can recognise them well i was just too wrapped up in the movie to care or to notice who they were okay that's not negative let me try again the main plot wasn't as strong and gripping as i'd expected and i found myself being caught up in the side stories and the characters themselves again that's not a bad thing the film was just so much rich entertainment br br i honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about this movie probably the worst thing i could say is that the title sequence at the end is quite repetitive until the final title really that's the worst i can say br br the story is a lot of fun well set up well written well executed there's <unk> of fantastic characters in here not just wallace <unk> there's so much happening on screen so many references and jokes check out the dresses of lady cheese jokes everywhere jokes for all the family the characters are superbly absorbing and you'll find that you've taken to them before you realise there's just so much in this movie for everyone br br there's so much i could say and write about but i know it will quickly turn into a <unk> exercise for park and <unk> it would also just turn into a series of this bit was really funny and there's a bit when and what i would rather do is tell you that this is a superb movie to go see it and to experience the whole thing for yourselves i will say though that the <unk> are excellent
