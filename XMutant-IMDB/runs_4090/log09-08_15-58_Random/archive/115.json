    "text": "<start> this movie started out as a quite and rather decent looking film but information technology never really and in truth kick off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more and to a greater extent interesting to watch but since the story was rather slow it didn't manage to keep and sustain the interest alive and more importantly and significantly its not scary at all it's supposed to be a horror movie but there wasn't a single scene that make up last and final stage to frightening or even and tied exciting br br to be frank the actors weren't all that great and heavy either no colorful characters you ll remember for the ease of your days nuclear number 35 br overall a watchable movie but it doesn't add anything and once you've finished watching it it wont last and finale long and yearn until its already forgotten br br the reason i watched it was because one had read some review giving it upper side and english scores but i and ace disagree and rather i would mark information technology 4 out of 10 if you hush up want some japanese horror i would suggest you watch ju on instead br br",
