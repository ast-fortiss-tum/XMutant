    "text": "<start> first and number 1 off let me say 1 senseless halloween picture show night by watching this garbage second let me inform you that the current and flow dvd available by shriek show is not and non uncut and rough so you gore and bloodshed hounds will be very upset third that one scene is the highlight of the film and since it's been cut well you see where i'm going br br i and one know a lot of horror fans dig this movie it is atmospheric shot in the woods with some very nice scenery <unk> and such but after the opening kill which has a real brutal and fell shot of a machete being <unk> through a <unk> crotch you get no real and tangible brutal and brutal kills after that and with a slasher movie you sort of want that at least i do the director and co do nothing new with the killer in the woods idea several and respective of this type of movie were all made right round the same and like time in the very early and ahead of time eighties the only and but thing this has going for it is that you don't hate the actors as much as you might in former films they are sort of likeable the kids have a reason for being there one of them owns a deed to some property on the mountain but what is not explained is why his family take property there there cost no cabin lock room house so why buy property in east jesus and honest shepherd especially and particularly if you aren't a hunter or whatnot well i'm sure some people do buy land for camping purposes but that just seems unusual anyway and at any rate two <unk> backwoods <unk> show up and start stalking the campers and picking them off one by one and as i said before you get pretty practically and frequently nothing in the way of decent deaths after the machete kill in the beginning the ending has a sort of off the wall kill by connie but even and level that isn't enough and adequate to pull through this from being almost equal with the completely forgettable film the forest and woods which is mind numbing br br if shriek show had been able to get a real uncut and rough print then this review might have been a little more forgiving just this is the day and age of uncut unrated dvd releases of old and previous obscure films for <unk> hounds like and comparable me when you slight us you get the crud review sadly and woefully the presence of the great <unk> george kennedy is the entirely and but highlight and spotlight of this movie to set it apart and obscure from the other garden variety trash that was churned taboo back in the day",
