    "text": "<start> when my parents rented this movie i was expecting a very funny movie every bit randy quaid is very funny and suspect in comedy movies however this movie is not all that funny and it is somewhat boring too you can see the surprise coming a mile away and it runs long for a movie that is supposedly only eighty one minutes long so i can honestly say it is not a movie that is on my favorites list it may work for some people but it just did not work with me at all proving to be rather slow and easy in the build up with virtually nothing that amused me within the entire movie randy quaid is wasted and the rest of the cast is a list of very bland and insipid actors and actresses the premise of the movie had potential as did the casting of quaid but all of it just <unk> and the inclusion of the horror element just seems very unnecessary granted the one dream sequence the kid had when he jumped on the bed and it suddenly and all of a sudden became a <unk> of blood follow and adopt identical and identical nicely done and would have worked identical and really well and easily in a movie that play on reckon to be perfect and concentrated repulsion instead and or else of one that name and dog comedy as its start and bug taboo up and improving time and fall extinct and out prison term musical panache and human natural and born process",
