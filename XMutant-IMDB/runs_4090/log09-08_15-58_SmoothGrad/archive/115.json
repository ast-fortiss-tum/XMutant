    "text": "<start> this movie started out as a quite decent looking film but it never really kicked off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was quite slow it didn't manage to keep the interest alive and more importantly its not scary at all it's supposed to be a horror movie but there wasn't a single scene that was close to frightening or even exciting br br to be frank and blunt the actors weren't all that great either atomic number 102 colorful and colored characters you ll remember for the rest of your days br br overall a watchable movie but it doesn't add anything and at one clip you've finished watching it it wont last long and yearn until its already forgotten br br the reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top scores but i and one differ and or else i would order it four out of ten if you still and still want some japanese repulsion i would key and key a scene you watch ju on rather and or else br and nuclear draw up 35 nuclear and nuclear tilt and cant 35",
