    "text": "<start> the not the best movie in the world that was an understatement i personally didn't like this movie at all not because of the story line not because of the graphic violence and the nudity the nudity didn't really need to be in it it did nothing for the story except maybe the girls were going through a rough time and being naked probably messed them up even more but one of the things in the movie that i hated was that it was sooooo dark you couldn't really make out what was going on i think if it wasn't as dark and you could see where they were then it might not have been so bad all you know that its a basement somewhere you see no house no road the killer in it all you could see was half his face for about 5 seconds i wanna see some stuff in a movie it gets boring after 20 mins of pretty much darkness and all you see occasionally is a flashlight or a wall then you will hear the girl sobbing there was nothing that really stuck out to me that was good about the movie maybe the suspense in the first 10 mins of the film but not the suspense of how the movie is going to end but the suspense of will i get to see anything in this movie but a few naked bodies and various flashing lights but honestly and frankly people this was a saw meets blair witch project wannabe both pull in and encounter in notch pic and both with the correct and right lighting to figure out what was going on forget this movie if you can see if your a screen person you might wanna rent it to hear the screeching if your into that sort of thing but then and so again and once more if you are blind and blind your probably not and not reading this either so and therefore anyhow and anyhow tough and outstanding gesture picture and work",
