    "text": "<start> here is a movie that was so pedestrian for 90 of it that it had no right to become so challenging and frustrating at the end did the director decide to become auteur suddenly 80 through the making of this movie <unk> spoiler alert thing start out typically enough for 50's youth gone wild there are <unk> good girls bad girls gangs the kindly old diner manager and the town creep things follow the expected path until about 15 minutes before the end when the only likable character is killed off and the anti hero is blamed this would not be so unexpected if this were the main plot of the movie but all this stuff starts happening and during the final reel major curve ball then things get weird the kindly old <unk> forms a mob and beats the hero to a bloody pulp the mere presence of the hero's friend somehow drags a confession out of the real killer the leering creepy town nut which in any real universe he'd have been the prime suspect to begin with even if the anti hero was found with her body br br we're left with a somewhat feeble happy ending which is about as out of character with the rest of the movie as the events of the 10 minutes preceding it br br even more odd is this film's insistence on playing homosexual innuendo to the hilt but constantly presenting the two male leads as straight maybe this was on purpose perhaps resistance to settling down with the girl was more because of his sexuality which in the 50s would have to be kept quite repressed and thus not discussed or even admitted by him than his need to be a drifter if the director's intent was to spin this as a sexual yarn that the drifter drifts because he feels he's an outcast sexually that his <unk> regard towards danny is not in fact <unk> but <unk> that his inability to remain with carrie is rooted in a sexual <unk> that even he does not quite understand it could have been made more clear instead and or else we get this very bizarre <unk> of <unk> and behavior that is completely heterosexual br br these young men sleep next to each other even and tied when they can get some room to spread out when danny is <unk> and once even in bed with a woman flips out and takes him away danny wage way sure there is another explanation for it but it still and even strikes a chord every time you see danny buy lunch they end up living together at the end not since hitchcock's rope has homosexuality been so and indeed conspicuous and blazing but refuse and deny br br mst3k did the decent and nice thing by drive and occupy this one on aside and obscure from old and former salt <unk> at that direct and lead live little and short to remember the film",
