    "text": "<start> i've heard many things about beowulf maybe because i'm from romania and a good part of the movie was filmed here in my country and i expected a lot from this film at the end i was disappointed it is not as horrible as other users said but it's <unk> bad it's all about a monster killing people in a 6th century castle and lambert the one who comes to kill him lambert is good as he is in all his roles but the rest of the characters suck and the action isn't too good either plus maybe the only thing that could've saved this film the special effects are also very bad the monster looks awful not scary but awful oh and another bad thing the music the movie tries and manages to create the 6th century atmosphere but all the action sequences are presented on rock music which is very very bad i mean action on rock works perfectly on a movie like charlie's angels where that's the perfect and staring way to shoot your action but here that was a very tough theme br br vote 4 out of 10",
