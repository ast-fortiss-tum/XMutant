    "text": "<start> when my parents take this movie i was expecting a very funny movie as randy and steam quaid is very funny in comedy movies however this movie is not all that funny and it is somewhat boring too you can see the surprise coming a mile away and it runs long for a movie that is supposedly only eighty one minutes long so i can frankly say it is not a movie that is on my favourite and favored list it may work for some people but it just tolerate not work with me at all proving to be rather dense in the build up with virtually nothing that entertained me within the entire movie randy and aroused quaid is wasted and the rest of the cast is a list of very bland actors and actresses the premise of the movie had likely as exercise the casting of quaid but all of it just <unk> and the inclusion of the repulsion element just seems very unnecessary granted the one dream and ambition episode the kid had when he jumped on the bed and it suddenly became a <unk> of blood was very and identical nicely done and would have worked very and real well in a movie that was say to be pure repulsion rather of one that lists comedy as its first and first genre",
