    "text": "<start> this is another alien faux and not a very good one at that replace extinct space with the south african desert throw in the same ingredients a group of people stranded in an <unk> landscape have them hunted down by an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very ordinary film trying to ape a classic film a radical of miners and scientists go on a hunt for some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert strip down clean of flesh their vehicle breaks down and they head for <unk> while being stalk by the monster the african position is pretty enough but that is fundamentally all this film has going for it there is a egotistical try to build up the tension but i found this didn't really work and made the film rather slack the creature didn't appear much and when it did it didn't really <unk> a feeling of horror there is one scene where somebody gets the flesh rip from his arm but that was essentially and fundamentally it on the gore front in conclusion i found this film about as exciting as watching key and fundamental wry i give this film iv 10 and that is only because of the interesting office which only isn't enough to make unnecessary this movie from being a total cat catch a eye blink fest",
