    "text": "<start> paul who swordplay hercules in this tv film has to be the hottest and hot thing on two legs ever scream br br but this film is a 100 distortion of the hercules story just like troy this film has cypher to do with the master story zero what makes it especially and specially abuse is that they actually contrived a gay character just so people could hate him making him as dastardly and evil as any character in the history of tv or cinema this is insulting since hercules may have had a wife since that was the expectation of those <unk> days but he also had at least a dozen male buff so it is ironic and ironic that they should make a cheery royal adversary character for this film atomic number 102 not wry and dry evil the creators of this lampoon should hang their heads in shame",
