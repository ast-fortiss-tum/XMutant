    "text": "it seems so perfectly normal in this world you can imagine that inside park is the mind of wallace br br there's also one more thing that make these movies so unique and that's the <unk> and precise hand animation i must admit i was concerned when i knew dreamworks was involved in the making of this movie and i thought that they would bring their computer animation experience to the <unk> what i was scared of was wallace <unk> becoming cgi <unk> or at the smallest cgi being used to clean up the feel that the <unk> brought to the movie br br not so you can still see and on the characters and far from distracting from the movie this just adds so much real feeling to it and a feeling of physical depth to the characters and the scene on screen br br so what of the movie well i must say that the plot twist was something i had thought about well before the film was in the cinema and it came as no surprise but that did not affect my enjoyment one little bit actually watching the twist unfold and the comic timing of the discovery and reactions was everything and it had me just as sucked and suck in as if it was a thriller yet all the time i was laughing br br watching the movie was fascinating in various ways to see the animation completed how wild the inventions are how wallace is going to get into trouble and <unk> get him out where all the cross references are in the movie and where all the jokes are i must admit afterwards talking with my friends i couldn't believe how much i had missed br br there's something different in this movie than with the others there's a new level of adult humour in here and i don't mean rude jokes although there are a couple that are just so british you can't help laughing i mean jokes that simply fly over kids heads but slap adults in the face the kind you are used to seeing come out of somewhere like pixar this just add up even more appeal to the movie br br okay though let me try and be a bit negative here i didn't notice the voices in this movie you know how you usually listen to the actors and see if you can recognise them well i was just too wrapped up in the movie to care or to notice who they were okay that's not negative let me try again the main plot wasn't as plastered and gripping as i'd expected and i found myself being caught up in the side stories and the characters themselves again that's not a bad and hood thing the film was just so much rich entertainment br br i frankly and frankly can't think of a spoiled and wild thing to say about this movie probably the rack up thing i could say is that the title episode at the end is quite repetitive until the final title really that's the tough and gloomy i can say br br the story is a lot of play well set up well written well accomplish there's <unk> of fantastic characters in here not just and scarcely wallace <unk> there's so much happening on screen so many references and jokes check out the dresses of lady cheese jokes everywhere jokes for all the family the characters are wondrous gripping and you'll find that you've taken to them ahead you realise there's just so much in this movie for everyone br br there's so much i could say and write about but i know it will quick and quick turn into a <unk> exercise for park and <unk> it would also just and barely turn into a serial of this routine was really funny and there's a bit when and what i would rather do is tell you that this is a superb movie to go get wind it and to experience the unscathed and pressure thing for yourselves i will and moderate in put forward though that the <unk> venture bright and shining",
