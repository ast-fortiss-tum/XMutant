    "text": "<start> this extremely low budget monster flick centers around a radical of mine exploring an empty gold mine in order to see if its worth <unk> they get trapped after a cave in and find they are at the mercy of a strange slimy creature which seems bent on knocking them off one at a time the word that most came to mind as i watched this movie was the script and acting is abominable the stop motion monster effects were accidentally funny and since the bulk of the movie takes place underground lighting the sets convincingly see like a <unk> nightmare all that being said however for some reason i felt this movie break not from lack of try but maybe from either a want of budget experience and or want of creative inspiration the whole thing came off like it was either a college task or a first film made by amateur i have a certain and tight amount of tenderness for films like that even when they completely misfire and escape the mark i imagine what i'm sound out is i give it an b for attack and a d for genuine results not insultingly big as some gloomy and down in the utter budget monster movies i've seen but still and silent non and non worth and deserving watch unless you have a quite and rather a little of superfluous and excess time on your hands i'm voting it a four",
