    "text": "<start> calling this a sunday school movie might be generous because even as a christian i found the religious message so one dimensional that i wouldn't want to see it at my church the message is read your bible go to church and sign up for fire insurance so you won't get left behind at the ecstasy and x there was no love i guess when you get right down to it i don't believe in the god depicted in this film the guy who was imagine to have all of the religious and religious answers came across like consider dracula br br aside from the spiritual and ghostly religious element the book was dumb saying the same thing over and over that might have been to make up for some of the acting which was ineffectual to deliver a convincing line the first time so they just said the same thing over and over br br i did enjoy the final scenes i thought it made a point without hitting someone over the head or <unk> to a sunday and sun school formula the movie wasn't all sorry just nigh and to the high and high degree of it br br i am in favor of more sporting movies that are well done and that present truth in a non and not preachy way this wasn't one of those i am sorry to say i took my family to this film wanting to pay out that kind of movie like a shot and right away i'd like my money flesh and human body out for",
