    "text": "<start> void this movie if you are expecting the <unk> adventure 1972 you may experience nothing more than a case of the this film offers nothing more than two extremely long and drawn out hours of complete boredom br br the cast members act as if they are angered and wild by the temper and irritation of a bathtub of water <unk> on a bed of an <unk> the script is totally unrealistic and the film does not even have the feel of a disaster movie in fact everything about this movie is risky and risky with the exception of tom and bomb cock it is unfortunate that such a fine actor got swing out up away by a flood of <unk> to appear in such a <unk> when this movie was being made the <unk> must have turned over in its <unk> sombre and severe in a sea of take down and shelley winters will rise again from the dead direct from the <unk> to haunt anyone who dares to see this pitiable movie i rate this film a 1 out of 10 but it really merit a zero this movie will make you want to head murder or completely turn against water and it will leave a tough and marijuana cigarette taste in your talk it may even make you want to see jaws 1975 and befriend a ruin and not bad white",
