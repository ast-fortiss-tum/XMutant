    "text": "<start> lame is really the best way to describe this movie it has a real poor script uninteresting dialog and characters and it's lacking in basically everything else as well br br there are too many characters and problem is that you don't care about any of them what the movie is lacking is one good and clear main character instead now the movie has a bit of everything it has a bit of an hero it has a bit of a love interest and it has a bit of villain i wish it only had a bit less <unk> though fore they are just mostly very annoying in this movie br br <unk> are guess to be devilish creatures who murder for pleasure in this movie however all they want to do is drink beer and watch naked college girls besides someone had the idea to let the <unk> be able to talk this time this works out really sickly and get to the <unk> tool had been unquestionably <unk> for this movie and they are more detailed looking and are able to do more however at the same time they are way more fake looking than the ones from the previous <unk> movies br br it's obvious that the design for this movie was more comedy than horror this time the movie is like a stay '80's high school comedy even though this movie got released in 1991 it's humor is really the rack up and most arrest thing about the entire movie it's so incredibly devil and simply not funny at all br br the story is non going anywhere with its story and the movie is just basically and essentially one big close up and mindless that never seems to end the <unk> plot line look fundamentally to have zero to do at all with the other plot lines of the movie involving the human characters the movie is non at all about the <unk> terrorize a college with the humans taste to hunt them down and stop their rampage atomic number 102 big surprise that this is brent merely written movie as of yet he simply has no talent for it and i think that he has break this as well and has gone back to college himself rather br br regular and authentic when comparison to the previous and of deep <unk> movies this movie is alone only get and amazing br br two decade",
