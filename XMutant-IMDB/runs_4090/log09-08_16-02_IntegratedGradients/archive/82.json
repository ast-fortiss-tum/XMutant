    "text": "<start> this movie suck the problem was not with the cast i think the cast was great lots of good talent lots of great acting but the script was terrible it seemed to be mostly just a frame work in which steve carrell could do his <unk> and that is what he does best but it just didn't work here the script was hard to follow the story was non <unk> and scenes were random and lacked direction also much of the action was extremely contrived and seriously thought out it was a good effort but as max says they missed it by that much i am shocked to see how many glowing reviews there are for this scum bag here on the imdb obviously the movie producers are getting people to write lots of confident reviews on their movies and satisfy up the entries on the imdb if you read the positive reviews and compare them to the negative reviews it is pretty clear which ones are genuine reviews from normal users br br this movie was full of problems and jokes that just didn't work i loved steve carrell in anchor man and i like his comedy and style but i will tell you that i never once laughed while i was watching this movie yes i had a couple of light moments a couple of chuckles but no real laughs goof and merry andrew egg that struck me at all br br spoiler alert one silly scene was when max had his hands <unk> on the airplane and he goes to the bathroom to try to escape he uses his special swiss army knife but or else of just using the blade of the knife he tries to shoot the <unk> with his miniature crossbow and as the crossbow lose and girl fires and shoots little arrows into him over and over again almost putting out his eye max doesn't give up or try the blade rather no he just keeps shooting himself with the crossbow what was he really expecting to do with that crossbow it seemed to be the risky and wild option on the stab to try to murder the <unk> it just made absolutely atomic number 102 sense br br that is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes that made up this movie they equal idiotic and nonsensical under the endure thought out ill motivated and made of pure nonsensical and that was truly and rightfully distract br br as i said this movie was a big allow mastered and i recommend you head off it a note to the imdb you should do something about these faux reviews that people are leaving it <unk> the authenticity of the place",
