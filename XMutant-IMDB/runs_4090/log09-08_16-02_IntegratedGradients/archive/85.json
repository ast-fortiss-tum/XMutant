    "text": "<unk> introduction of the crew we have essentially a film about this crew trapped in a space ship with a vampire lurking about br br i'm a very forgiving viewer when it comes to low budget films occasionally they can be brilliant see <unk> first two evil dead films dracula 3000 had a decent budget enough for some decent special effects and for the <unk> of 3rd like van dien erika eleniak <unk> etc however unlike the evil dead flicks there is no talent behind the camera in front of the camera the talent is marginal but i'm going to give the actors some benefit of the doubt it really seems like they don't know what to do the best actor of the bunch alexandra <unk> gets killed off quickly and the ever enjoyable <unk> <unk> is reduced to being an exposition vehicle for the viewer as the deceased captain we hear and see via a video journal grant is also okay as the professor but it's hard to take seriously a scientist in the year 3000 who wears glasses and rides a wheel chair and yes it's a wheel chair as in there is nothing futuristic about it as for the rest of the actors i'm sure <unk> really tried to be scary after getting turned into a vampire but well i don't think irritating qualifies as scary in most people's book tiny <unk> and erika eleniak don't really provide much either <unk> is never really more then the <unk> big <unk> black stereotype eleniak actually appears unhappy throughout the film and never tries very hard eleniak is a pretty girl even in her mid thirties but looks a little worn out and <unk> for the movie's duration br br this brings us to count dracula <unk> played by <unk> to be honest i can't recall who exactly the vampire is supposed to be he introduces himself as <unk> but at some point he <unk> himself as count dracula as well go figure in any case you will be absolutely <unk> by just how feeble this vampire is have you ever scene those cheesy horror show hosts local networks would have on their creature feature time <unk> yes it's that bad <unk> the actor playing must have found it almost impossible to digest in such a ridiculous outfit i'm sure he's still getting <unk> by his friends br br there isn't much to the plot the vampire is the last of it's kind and wants to go to earth for some reason and also there is some lip service about wanting to defeat <unk> van character van helsing most of the crew get turned into vampires including van helsing and the crew use conventional machine guns and <unk> to try and defeat them before they figure out the old stake in the heart routine yea that's right smoke and yes the year 3000 keeping in that baffling vein one of the main country the crew fix themselves up in while battling the vampire or vampire since there is really never more then one menace them is meet with old soviet posters and <unk> and such what the there are also references to god religion being <unk> systems but these references alone confused me did the soviet union make a comeback is there some point <unk> and want to make with this it never really goes anywhere appear dumb and the posters etc just look trashy br br on the confident and positive side the film is competently shot and edited the cinematography is nothing spectacular and prominent but it's clearly done by master and i had no trouble with the special effects the ships look like ships in extinct space although as i compose and compose this i recall how god abominable the corpse of the captain looks when the crew discover him what were they thinking why didn't someone say something see how difficult it is to say something win over about this film without falling back on the negatives i judge ultimately that's the thing whatever positives you try and grant this sci fi repulsion debacle you become float by it's want of quality br br pitiable <unk> <unk>",
