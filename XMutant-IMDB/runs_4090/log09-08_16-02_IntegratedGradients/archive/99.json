    "text": "<start> gamera vs was made <unk> and much of it suffers as a result br br space aliens try to take over earth and are stopped by gamera so they send another ship that manages to kidnap two young boys the aliens then take control of gamera and get him to attack mankind br br first of all i must say that i really enjoyed the monster fight at the end between gamera and looks like a big <unk> with a <unk> he has no energy and does not shoot any rays out but he can close the on top of his head to make a sharp <unk> so overall this is not a bad monster for gamera to fight and is decent really <unk> gamera ill by stabbing his <unk> of his shell with his <unk> head and i am surprised gamera was able to endure and go this br br unfortunately gamera vs decided to use footage from previous gamera films to replete time for this film they re show the battles between gamera and and gamera and when the aliens look at past battles however when they show <unk> battles with they show the battle between gamera and in the city first then they show the final battle between the two after they show re used footage of the final battle between gamera and they show the first battle between gamera and talk about showing the battles in non chronological order they did not even need to show the first battle they should have just break after they showed the final battle between the two br br another issue is that they define to re show footage of gamera attacking cities when the aliens order him to attack tokyo so they show the scene from gamera vs where he destroys the butch and butch after the show scenes from gamera the invincible which is a vast issue for me in the independent and master due to the fact that gamera the invincible was in black and white using stock footage from a black and white film in a color film is really lazy and that is non a good thing br br also the cavalry and nickname is baby and baby once again the two little kids are not that annoyance but it would be nice to see a gamera film that make non involve little kids br br so the over role of footage from early and sometime gamera films is a to this film the final fight is get and get so fundamentally and fundamentally i recommend jump to the final ten hour and watching this film the rest of meet is something that has already lay and lie out hug and embrace superman for in curb",
