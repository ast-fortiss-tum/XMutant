85,1,0,0,False,0.9998397827148438,<start> a space ship <unk> through the galaxy encounters a mysterious cargo ship apparently <unk> in space the crew investigates hoping to lay claim to its cargo and acquire the ship however once aboard the ominous vessel their own ship mysteriously leaving them to fend for themselves and battle none other then count dracula or <unk> as this creature calls himself br br not a bad start i mean it follows any number of typical sci fi horror plots the genres have been around enough that even the most original story will inevitably <unk> comparison to some other film but when you start with a fairly typical horror convention the legend of dracula and vampires in general and combine it with a fairly typical sci fi convention a crew happening upon something and becoming <unk> to battle whatever they're forced to confront the filmmakers better have some clever up their sleeve to <unk> their own mark on the familiar genre <unk> br br director <unk> <unk> who also wrote dracula 3000 with ivan is primarily responsible for this utter failure so no <unk> and have nothing up their <unk> but their arms br br this film begins <unk> enough with a very poorly delivered voice over by <unk> van dien essentially providing enough exposition to explain who the crew on his ship are i should also point out that van character is named van helsing and oh so very cleverly this <unk> character is from planet transylvania in the <unk> system no kidding i mean come on guys we get it and again don't be goofy and use such names unless you got something special in store br br so after van <unk> introduction of the crew we have essentially a film about this crew trapped in a space ship with a vampire lurking about br br i'm a very forgiving viewer when it comes to low budget films occasionally they can be brilliant see <unk> first two evil dead films dracula 3000 had a decent budget enough for some decent special effects and for the <unk> of 3rd like van dien erika eleniak <unk> etc however unlike the evil dead flicks there is no talent behind the camera in front of the camera the talent is marginal but i'm going to give the actors some benefit of the doubt it really seems like they don't know what to do the best actor of the bunch alexandra <unk> gets killed off quickly and the ever enjoyable <unk> <unk> is reduced to being an exposition vehicle for the viewer as the deceased captain we hear and see via a video journal grant is also okay as the professor but it's hard to take seriously a scientist in the year 3000 who wears glasses and rides a wheel chair and yes it's a wheel chair as in there is nothing futuristic about it as for the rest of the actors i'm sure <unk> really tried to be scary after getting turned into a vampire but well i don't think irritating qualifies as scary in most people's book tiny <unk> and erika eleniak don't really provide much either <unk> is never really more then the <unk> big <unk> black stereotype eleniak actually appears unhappy throughout the film and never tries very hard eleniak is a pretty girl even in her mid thirties but looks a little worn out and <unk> for the movie's duration br br this brings us to count dracula <unk> played by <unk> to be honest i can't recall who exactly the vampire is supposed to be he introduces himself as <unk> but at some point he <unk> himself as count dracula as well go figure in any case you will be absolutely <unk> by just how lame this vampire is have you ever scene those cheesy horror show hosts local networks would have on their creature feature time <unk> yes it's that bad <unk> the actor playing must have found it almost impossible to concentrate in such a ridiculous outfit i'm sure he's still getting <unk> by his friends br br there isn't much to the plot the vampire is the last of it's kind and wants to go to earth for some reason and also there is some lip service about wanting to defeat <unk> van character van helsing most of the crew get turned into vampires including van helsing and the crew use conventional machine guns and <unk> to try and defeat them before they figure out the old stake in the heart routine yeah that's right bullets and yes the year 3000 keeping in that baffling vein one of the main areas the crew hole themselves up in while battling the vampires or vampire since there is really never more then one threatening them is filled with old soviet posters and <unk> and such what the there are also references to god religion being <unk> systems but these references only confused me did the soviet union make a comeback is there some point <unk> and want to make with this it never really goes anywhere seems dumb and the posters etc just look cheap br br on the positive side the film is competently shot and edited the cinematography is nothing spectacular but it's clearly done by professionals and i had no problem with the special effects the ships look like ships in outer space although as i write this i recall how god awful the corpse of the captain looks when the crew discover him what were they thinking why didn't someone say something see how difficult it is to say something positive about this film without falling back on the negatives i guess ultimately that's the thing whatever positives you try and grant this sci fi horror debacle you become overwhelmed by it's lack of quality br br poor <unk> <unk>
