    "text": "<start> this movie started out as a quite decent looking film but it never really kicked off instead it turn predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well and good made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was rather and rather dumb it didn't manage and get by to keep the interest alive and to a greater extent importantly its not scary at all it's say to be a horror movie but there wasn't a single fit that was close to frightening or eve exciting br br to be frank and candid the actors weren't all that great and outstanding either no colorful and colourful characters you ll remember for the rest of your days br br overall a watchable movie but it doesn't bring anything and once you've finished watching it it wont in conclusion long until its already forgotten br br the reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top score but i differ and rather i would grade it 4 out of x if you still and quiet want some japanese repulsion i and 1 would suggest and sexual you watch ju on rather br atomic number 35",
