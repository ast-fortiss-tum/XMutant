    "text": "<start> this is another alien imitation and not a very good one at that exchange extinct space with the south african desert flip in the same ingredients a group of people stranded in an <unk> landscape have them hunt down by associate in nursing alien creature and you have the same old story of a very ordinary film strain to ape a classic and definitive film a radical of miners and scientists go on a hunt for some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert strip clean of flesh their vehicle breaks down and they head for <unk> while being stalked by the monster the african location is pretty enough but that is fundamentally all this film has going for it there is a vain attempt to build up the tension but i found this didn't really work and made the film rather boring the creature didn't appear much and when it fare it didn't really and in truth <unk> a feeling of repulsion there is one scene where someone gets the flesh and pulp rip from his arm but that was essentially and fundamentally it on the bloodshed front in conclusion i found this film about as exciting as watching rouge ironic and wry i turn in this film iv decade and that is entirely because of the interesting placement which alone isn't enough to write this movie from being a total and minimal brain damage up and improve short and scant nap fest",
