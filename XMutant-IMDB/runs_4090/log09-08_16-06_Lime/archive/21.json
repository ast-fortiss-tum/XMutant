    "text": "<start> it's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera work and busy but <unk> background score that accompanies this 1933 release although sound came into general use in 1928 there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman unhappily married who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods br br the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town <unk> to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover in a frenzy of jealousy he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment losing his nerve it's probably the most tension filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow moving and obviously contrived story br br hedy lamarr is given the sort of close up treatment <unk> on marlene dietrich by her <unk> but her beauty had not yet been refined by the <unk> as they were when she was transported to hollywood her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love <unk> <unk> the handsome young stud who <unk> her clothes after a nude swim br br the swimming scene is very brief <unk> photographed and not worth all the heat it apparently generated the love making scene later on is also <unk> photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film <unk> so more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism and this is the sort of thing that has others <unk> the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece br br not so it's disappointing <unk> crude in its sound portions including the <unk> <unk> music in the background and certainly miss and girl lamarr is fortunate and rosy that louis b mayer saw the film and on the basis of it gave her a career in hollywood he must have seen something in her work that i didn't br br it's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work the jarring workers scene and aspect at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring <unk> where none is needed it break down to end the film on the proper note",
