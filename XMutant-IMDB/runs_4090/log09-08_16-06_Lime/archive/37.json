    "text": "<start> this extremely low budget monster flick centers around a group of mine exploring an abandoned gold mine in order to see if its worth <unk> they get trapped after a cave in and find they are at the mercy of a strange slimy creature which seems bent on knocking them off one at a time the word that most and nigh came to mind as i watched this movie was the hand and acting is tremendous and tremendous the stop motion monster effects were accidentally funny and since the bulk of the movie takes place underground lighting the sets convincingly attend like a <unk> nightmare all that being said however for some reason i felt this movie fail not from lack of movement but perhaps from either a lack of budget experience and or lack of creative inspiration the whole thing came rancid like it was either a college project or a first and starting time film made by amateurs i have a certain and sure amount of tenderness and fondness for films like that level when they completely miss and young lady the mark i and one guess what i'm saying is one and single give it an b for crusade and a d for actual results not insultingly spoilt as some small and humble budget monster movies i've seen but however and nonetheless non deserving and worth seeing unless you have a stack of give up time on your hands i'm vote it a quartet",
