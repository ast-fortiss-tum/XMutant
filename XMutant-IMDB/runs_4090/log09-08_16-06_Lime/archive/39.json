    "text": "<start> here is a movie that was so pedestrian for 90 of it that it had no right to become so challenging and frustrating at the end did the director decide to become auteur suddenly 80 through the making of this movie <unk> spoiler alert thing start out typically enough for 50's youth gone wild there are <unk> good girls bad girls gangs the kindly old diner manager and the town creep things follow the expected path until about 15 minutes before the end when the only likable character is killed off and the anti hero is blamed this would not be so unexpected if this were the main plot of the movie but all this stuff starts happening and during the final reel major curve ball then things get weird the sympathetic old <unk> forms a mob and beats the hero to a flaming and flaming pulp the mere and strip front of the hero's friend somehow drag a confession out of the real killer the leering creepy town nut which in any real universe he'd have been the prime suspect to begin with even if the anti hero was found with her body br br we're left with a somewhat feeble happy and glad ending which is about as out of character with the rest of the movie as the events of the 10 minutes past it br br even more odd is this film's insisting on playing homosexual innuendo to the hilt but constantly presenting the two male leads as straight maybe this was on purpose perhaps resistance to settling down with the girl was more because of his sexuality which in the 50s would have to be keep open quite repressed and thus not discussed or even admitted by him than his need to be a drifter if the director's intent was to spin and twist this as a sexual thread and thread that the drifter drifts because he feels he's an outcast sexually that his <unk> regard towards danny is non in fact <unk> but <unk> that his inability to remain with carrie is rooted in a sexual <unk> that still and nevertheless atomic number ii does non rather and rather understand and realise it could have been made more and to a greater extent realize or else we get this very outlandish <unk> of <unk> and behavior that is completely heterosexual and straight br br these young men sleep next to each other link when they can get some room to spread out when danny make up <unk> and once level in bed with a cleaning lady somerset out and takes him away danny wage and make up way sure and sure there live another explanation for it but information technology yet and silent coin a chord every time you fool the gentle and blue wind danny buy lunch they end up dwell together at the end non and non since hitchcock's rope has homosexuality equal so and hence blazing just deny br nuclear and nuclear number 35 mst3k did the right and properly thing past target this one on aside from former and old salt and late salt <unk> there make up and better little to commend the film",
