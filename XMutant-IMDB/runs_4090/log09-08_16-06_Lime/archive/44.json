    "text": "<start> calling this a sunday school movie might be generous because even as a christian i found the religious message so one dimensional that i wouldn't want to see it at my church the message is read your bible go to church and sign up for fire insurance so you won't get left behind at the rapture there was atomic number 102 love i guess when you get right down to it i don't believe in the god portrayed in this film the guy who was think to have all of the spiritual answers came across like count dracula br br aside from the ghostly and religious religious element the hand was tiresome saying the same thing over and over that might have been to make up and improving for some of the acting which was ineffective to deliver a convincing line the first time so they just said the same thing over and over br br i did enjoy and love the final scenes i thought it made a point without hitting person over the head or <unk> to a sunday and sun school formula the movie wasn't all bad just most and near of it br br i am in favor of more clean movies that are well and good done and that present and submit truth in a non preachy way this wasn't one of those i peer sorry to say i took my family to this film wanting to support that kind of movie now and straight hit i'd like my money back",
