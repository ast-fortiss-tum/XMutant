    "text": "<start> lame is really the well way to describe and line this movie it has a real poor script uninteresting dialog and characters and it's lacking in basically everything else as well br br there are too many characters and problem is that you don't care about any of them what the movie is lacking is one good and clear main character instead now the movie has a bit of everything it has a bit of an hero it has a bit of a love interest and it has a bit of villain i wish it only had a bit less <unk> though fore they are just mostly very annoying in this movie br br <unk> are supposed to be devilish creatures who murder for pleasure in this movie however all they want to do is drink beer and watch naked college girls besides someone had the idea to let the <unk> be able to talk this time this works out really poorly and irritate the <unk> tool had been definitely and by all odds <unk> for this movie and they are more detailed looking and are able to do more however at the same time they are way more fake looking than the ones from the previous <unk> movies br br it's obvious that the aim for this movie was more and to a greater extent comedy than horror this time the movie is like a lame '80's high school comedy even though this movie got released in 1991 it's humor is really the big and most game thing about the entire movie it's so incredibly annoyance and simply not funny at all br br the story is not going anywhere with its story and the movie is just essentially and fundamentally one big pot and quite a little that never seems to end the <unk> plot line seems fundamentally to have nada to do at all with the early plot lines of the movie involving the human characters the movie is non at all about the <unk> terrorizing a college with the humans trying to hunt them down and stop their rampage no big and bad surprise that this is brent lone written movie as of yet he simply has atomic number 102 talent for it and i think that he has discovered this as well and has gone back to college himself or else br br even when compared to the previous and late <unk> movies this movie be simply simply dreaded br br ii ecstasy and go",
