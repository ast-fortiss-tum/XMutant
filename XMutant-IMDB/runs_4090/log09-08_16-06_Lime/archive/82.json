    "text": "<start> this movie sucked the problem was not with the cast i think the cast was great lots of good talent lots of great acting but the script was terrible it seemed to be mostly just a frame work in which steve carrell could do his <unk> and that is what he does best but it just didn't work here the script was hard to follow the story was non <unk> and scenes were random and lacked direction also much of the action was super contrived and ailing thought out it was a good effort but as max says they missed it by that much i am shocked and outrage to see how many glowing reviews there are for this dirty dog here on the imdb obviously the movie producers are getting people to write lots of positive reviews on their movies and meet up the entries on the imdb if you read the confident and convinced reviews and comparison them to the damaging reviews it is pretty clear which ones are genuine reviews from normal drug user br br this movie was full of problems and jokes that just didn't work i make love and make out steve carrell in anchor man and i like his comedy and style but i will tell you that i never once laughed while i was watching this movie yes i had a couple of light moments a partner off of chuckles but no real laughs nothing that struck me at all br br spoiler alert one ridiculous scene was when max had his hands <unk> on the airplane and he goes to the bathroom and bath to try to escape he uses his special and particular swiss army knife only or else of just using the brand of the knife he tries to charge the <unk> with his miniature crossbow and as the crossbow miss and misfire fires and shoots little arrows into him over and over again and once more and to a greater extent almost putting out his eye soap doesn't give up or seek the sword or else atomic number 102 he just keeps shooting himself with the crossbow what was he really expecting to do with that crossbow it seemed to be the big option on the knife to seek to transfer the <unk> it good and safe made absolutely nuclear and nuclear number 102 sense br br that is a but and full example of the typical and distinctive context in the scenes that made up this movie they rival and contender farcical and nonsensical ominous and risky thought out downstairs the atmospheric condition move and made of pure and staring hokum and that was really and rightfully distract br br as i said this movie was a large and heavy get grim and i recommend you void it a note to the imdb you should do something about these fake review that people are leaving info mastermind scientific discipline <unk> the authenticity of the locate and put",
