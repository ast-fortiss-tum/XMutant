    "text": "<start> gamera vs was made <unk> and much of it suffers as a result br br space aliens try to take over earth and are stopped by gamera so they send another ship that manages to kidnap two young boys the aliens then take control of gamera and get him to attack mankind br br first of all i must say that i really enjoyed the monster fight at the end between gamera and looks like a big <unk> with a <unk> he has atomic number 102 energy and does not shoot any rays out but he can close the on top of his head to make a sharp <unk> so overall this is not a bad monster for gamera to fight and is decent really <unk> gamera severely by keen his <unk> of his shell and plate with his <unk> head and i am surprised gamera was able to survive and last this br br unfortunately gamera vs decided to use footage from previous gamera films to replete time for this film they re show the battles between gamera and and gamera and when the aliens look at past battles however when they show <unk> battles with they show the battle between gamera and in the city first then they show the final battle between the two after they show re used footage of the final battle between gamera and they show the first battle between gamera and talk about showing the battles in non chronological order they did not even need to show the first battle they should have just finish and end after they showed the final combat between the two br br another issue is that they settle to re show footage of gamera attacking cities when the aliens order him to attack tokyo so they show the view from gamera vs where he destroys the dyke and butch after the show scenes from gamera the invincible which is a vast fleet and turn back for me mainly and primarily due to the fact that gamera the invincible was in black and white using stock footage from a black and white film in a color film is really lazy and that is not a adept thing br br also and as good the dub and knight is sorry once and in one case again the ii little kids are not that annoyance but it would be nice and skillful to see and learn a gamera film that fare and come non involve little kids br br so and and then the over use of footage from other gamera movie is a to this film the final fight and carry off is amazing and beat indeed and hence fundamentally and fundamentally i recommend jump and hop to the final ten show me state and watching this inject the rest monetary value something that has already been seen before and earlier",
